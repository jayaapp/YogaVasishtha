Sandhi changes \"na iha\" to \"neha.\" Often paired with \"na amutra\" (not there) to indicate \"neither here nor there\"—pointing to the transcendent.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Indicates that Brahman/ātman is not confined to any loka (realm) or deśa (place); it is neither in the earthly realm (iha) nor exclusively in the heavenly realm (amutra), but transcends all spatial categories while pervading all\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: Points to the recognition that true Self is not located in any particular cakra, nāḍī, or bodily region despite appearing to be associated with them; meditation deepens from localized concentration to spacious awareness that is \"neha\"—not confined to \"here\"\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Relates to the formless, locationless aspect of divinity (nirguṇa, nirākāra) that cannot be said to dwell \"here\" or \"there\" but is the substratum of all places\n- **Mantric Significance**: Connected to the understanding that the source of mantra is not located in the mouth, throat, or even subtle centers, but is the unlimited consciousness from which all sound emanates\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Often appears in apophatic (neti-neti, \"not this, not this\") teachings; the phrase \"neha nānāsti kiṃcana\" (here there is no diversity whatsoever) from Bṛhadāraṇyaka and Kaṭha Upaniṣads uses neha to deny multiplicity in Brahman; also used to teach that liberation (mokṣa) is not a location one goes to (neha—not here, na amutra—not there) but the recognition of what always is\n- **Symbolic Representation**: The negation of \"here\" points to the everywhere-and-nowhere quality of consciousness; symbolized by space that cannot be said to be particularly \"here\" or \"there\"\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Found throughout Upaniṣadic literature (particularly Bṛhadāraṇyaka, Kaṭha, Muṇḍaka) in passages describing the non-locatable nature of Brahman; appears frequently in Yoga Vāsiṣṭha in discussions of the apparent versus real, the transcendent versus immanent nature of consciousness",

Think of them as the \"logicians\" or \"rationalists\" of Indian philosophy.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: The Nyāya system, while developing sophisticated logical analysis, ultimately aims at liberation (mokṣa) through right knowledge; Naiyāyikas posit 16 categories (padārthas) including means of valid knowledge (pramāṇas), objects of knowledge (prameyas), and methods of debate—all serving the goal of understanding reality\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: Nyāya philosophy is associated with the buddhi-tattva (intellect principle) and the function of discernment; represents the sharp discriminative capacity necessary for spiritual progress, though Vedanta sometimes critiques over-reliance on mere logic\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Associated with Akṣapāda Gautama (the legendary founder of Nyāya) and with deities of wisdom like Gaṇeśa who removes obstacles to understanding and Sarasvatī who grants discriminative knowledge\n- **Mantric Significance**: While Naiyāyikas focus on logic rather than mantra, their epistemology includes śabda-pramāṇa (verbal testimony), acknowledging the Vedas as valid means of knowledge—thus connecting rational analysis to revealed sound\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Nyāya represents one of the six orthodox darśanas (ṣaḍ-darśanas) of Hindu philosophy; in inter-philosophical discussions, Advaita Vedanta both draws upon Nyāya logic (particularly in works like Nyāya-mañjarī) and critiques its realistic metaphysics; the Naiyāyikas' emphasis on pramāṇas (valid means of knowledge) complements but differs from Vedanta's emphasis on direct realization through guru-śāstra-ātmānubhava\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Symbolized by the tools of logical analysis—the syllogism (nyāya-vākya), the five-membered argument (pañcāvayava), the sharp sword of discrimination (viveka-khaḍga)\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Nyāya Sūtras of Gautama (Akṣapāda), commentaries like Vātsyāyana's Nyāya Bhāṣya, and Udayana's works; mentioned in Yoga Vāsiṣṭha in contexts comparing different philosophical approaches; referenced throughout Sanskrit philosophical literature in debates (vāda) between schools",

Remember the five: vāk (speech), pāṇi (hands), pāda (feet), pāyu (excretion), upastha (reproduction). Mnemonic: \"Speaking, Handling, Pedestrian, Purging, Procreating.\"\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: In Sāṃkhya cosmology, the karmendriyas emerge from the ahaṃkāra (ego-principle) in its tamasic (inertial/material) mode, along with the jñānendriyas; they represent the active, expressive dimension of embodied existence; through these, the puruṣa (consciousness) appears to act in the world, though ultimately puruṣa itself is actionless (akartā)\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: Each karmendriya is associated with specific prāṇa flows and subtle body locations; in yogic practice, bringing awareness to and controlling the karmendriyas is essential for restraining outward-flowing energy; the practice of pratyāhāra (sense-withdrawal) includes withdrawing energy from these action organs; each indriya has corresponding nāḍīs and marma points\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Each karmendriya has presiding deities: Agni (fire) for vāk, Indra for pāṇi, Viṣṇu for pāda, Mitra for pāyu, Prajāpati for upastha; these devatās are not external gods but the conscious principles governing each faculty\n- **Mantric Significance**: In nyāsa practices, mantras are placed on each karmendriya to sanctify and energize them; the control of vāk (speech) is particularly emphasized in mantra-sādhana as the primary karmendriya for spiritual expression\n- **Dharmic Significance**: The karmendriyas are the instruments through which karma is created; right use of these organs (vāk in satya/truth, pāṇi in dāna/giving, etc.) leads to dharmic living; in Vedantic analysis, recognizing that \"I am not the doer\" (naiva kartā) despite the apparent activity of karmendriyas is crucial for liberation; the jñānī uses these organs naturally without identification\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Often depicted in yogic diagrams showing the subtle body; in some iconography, deities are shown with multiple arms representing the karmendriyas' powers; the five-fold expression of divine activity\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Systematically described in Sāṃkhya Kārikā (verses 26-28), elaborated in Yoga Vāsiṣṭha, discussed in Bhagavad Gītā (III.6-7 on restraint of karmendriyas while mind dwells on sense objects), detailed in Vedānta Sāra and other Vedantic primers, central to Tantric teachings on the subtle body",

Memorize the sequence from gross to subtle: Anna (food/body), Prāṇa (energy), Manas (mind), Vijñāna (intellect/wisdom), Ānanda (bliss). Each is \"maya\" (made of) that substance.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: The pañcakośas represent the progressive stages of manifestation from pure consciousness to gross matter; they constitute the complete embodied being (jīva); in the cosmology of emanation, consciousness steps down through increasingly dense layers until physical form emerges; liberation involves the reverse journey, recognizing that one is not any of these kośas but the witnessing consciousness behind them all\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: Each kośa has specific characteristics and practices: annamaya is addressed through āsana and diet; prāṇamaya through prāṇāyāma; manomaya through concentration and mantra; vijñānamaya through study and discrimination (viveka); ānandamaya through deep meditation and samādhi; the goal is kośa-viveka (discrimination of sheaths) leading to recognition of oneself as kośātīta (beyond all sheaths)\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Each kośa is associated with different aspects of divine presence: annamaya with Viśva (waking state deity), prāṇamaya with life-giving deities like Prāṇa-devata, manomaya with Hiraṇyagarbha (cosmic mind), vijñānamaya with Īśvara (cosmic intelligence), ānandamaya with the causal ground approaching Brahman\n- **Mantric Significance**: Different mantras resonate at different kośa levels; gross mantras work on outer kośas, subtle ones penetrate deeper; the progression of sādhana moves from loud chanting (affecting annamaya) through silent mental repetition (manomaya) to absorption in the mantra's essence (vijñānamaya-ānandamaya)\n- **Dharmic Significance**: The pañcakośa model is fundamental to Advaita Vedanta's methodology of self-inquiry; through the practice of \"neti-neti\" (not this, not this), the seeker systematically investigates and transcends identification with each kośa, ultimately recognizing \"I am not the body (annamaya), not the breath (prāṇamaya), not the mind (manomaya), not the intellect (vijñānamaya), not even the sense of bliss (ānandamaya)—I am the pure witness consciousness (sākṣi-caitanya) beyond all coverings\"\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Often depicted as concentric circles or nested sheaths around a central point of light (the ātman); like the layers of an onion or Russian nesting dolls; sometimes shown as progressive halos around a meditating figure\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: The foundational teaching appears in Taittirīya Upaniṣad (Brahma-valli/Ānanda-valli, II-III) where Varuṇa teaches his son Bhṛgu through progressive inquiry into the nature of Brahman through the kośas; elaborated in Yoga Vāsiṣṭha's discussions of self-inquiry; central to Vedānta Sāra, Pañcadaśī, Vivekacūḍāmaṇi, and all Advaita Vedantic works on sādhana methodology",

Sit cross-legged with each foot on opposite thigh—this is the \"lotus\" position, resembling a closed lotus flower.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Padmāsana represents the stable foundation for spiritual ascent; the grounded lotus-posture mirrors the cosmic lotus from which creation unfolds; sitting in padmāsana, the practitioner becomes like mount Meru, the stable axis of the universe; the locked position creates a closed energetic circuit optimal for inner work\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: Padmāsana is considered supreme for prāṇāyāma and meditation because it locks the prāṇic energy in the central channel (suṣumnā), preventing downward dissipation through apāna; the crossed legs and upturned feet create natural bandhas (energy locks); facilitates kuṇḍalinī awakening by providing stable base; the symmetry balances iḍā and piṅgalā nāḍīs; the firm seat prevents distraction and allows prāṇa to rise; mūlādhāra is pressed, activating root energy\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: All meditating deities—Śiva, Buddha, Jain Tīrthaṅkaras—are depicted in padmāsana; the posture itself is considered sacred; Lakṣmī and other deities sit on lotus thrones (padma-pīṭha); assuming padmāsana is said to invoke the stable, meditative aspect of the divine\n- **Mantric Significance**: Padmāsana is the traditional posture for japa (mantra repetition); the stability allows the practitioner to forget the body and merge with the mantra; the locked position intensifies the internal resonance of mantric vibration\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Mastery of padmāsana indicates readiness for deeper yogic practices; represents āsana-jaya (conquest of posture) mentioned in Yoga Sūtras; symbolizes the stability required for samādhi; the ability to sit comfortably for extended periods in padmāsana is considered a prerequisite for advanced prāṇāyāma and meditation; philosophically, the closed lotus-posture represents pratyāhāra—withdrawal from external engagement\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Universally depicted in yogic and Buddhist iconography; meditating figure in padmāsana is the quintessential image of inner stillness; yantras often show deities or syllables at the center of lotus-mandalas, mirroring the practitioner centered in padmāsana; the posture symbolizes the blooming of inner consciousness\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Extensively described in Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā (I.44-49, calling it the destroyer of all diseases), Gheraṇḍa Saṃhitā (II.8), Śiva Saṃhitā, referenced in Yoga Sūtras' emphasis on sthira-sukham āsanam (steady, comfortable posture), Yoga Vāsiṣṭha mentions it in meditation contexts, Buddhist texts on dhyāna postures, throughout tantric sādhana manuals",
  "पबित्रं": "# पबित्रं\n**Transliteration**: pa-vi-traṃ\n**POS**: adjective/noun (neuter, accusative singular)\n\n**Root Analysis**:\n- This appears to be a variant or dialectical spelling of पवित्र (pavitra): √पू (pū) – \"to purify, cleanse\" + इत्र (itra) instrumental suffix = पवित्र (pavitra) \"purifier, purifying, sacred, holy\" (the form पबित्रं may reflect phonetic variation where व (v) → ब (b))\n\n**Meanings**:\n- Literal: purifying, sacred, holy, pure; that which purifies or sanctifies (variant spelling of pavitra)\n- Contextual: same meanings as पवित्र—refers to sacred objects, purifying agents, holy persons, or sanctifying rituals; in Vedic contexts, may refer to the purifying grass or strainer used in soma rituals\n- Symbolic: represents the purifying principle; that which removes impurity and restores sacred order\n\n**Learning Tip**:\n- \"Pavitraṃ\" (or pabitraṃ in this spelling) – variant of the common word pavitra meaning \"pure/purifying/sacred.\" The v/b variation occurs in some dialectical or manuscript traditions.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Pavitra represents the purifying power (śuddhi-śakti) inherent in the divine; the principle that cleanses ignorance and reveals underlying purity; in cosmology, the purifying aspect of agni (fire) and other tattvas\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: Refers to purification practices (śodhana) that cleanse nāḍīs, remove blocks, and prepare the subtle body for higher practice; prāṇāyāma is pavitra because it purifies prāṇa; mantra is pavitra because it purifies citta\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Associated with purifying deities—Agni (purifying fire), Gaṅgā (purifying waters), Vāyu (purifying air); the entire category of pavitra-devatās who bestow sanctity\n- **Mantric Significance**: Sacred mantras themselves are pavitra; the Gāyatrī mantra is supremely pavitra; utterance of divine names purifies the speaker and environment\n- **Dharmic Significance**: In Vedanta, jñāna (knowledge) is described as the ultimate pavitra—the purifier that burns all karmas and reveals the eternally pure ātman; the guru, śāstra, and satsaṅga are pavitra because they lead to purification; recognizing one's inherent purity (nitya-śuddha-svarūpa) is the highest pavitra-jñāna\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Symbolized by sacred grass (kuśa/darbha), sacred thread (yajñopavīta), holy water, fire, and purifying wind; depicted in ritual contexts as strainers and purifying implements\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Throughout Vedic literature in purification contexts (pavitra-ślokas), Yoga Vāsiṣṭha on the purifying power of knowledge, Bhagavad Gītā (IV.38, \"jñāna is the supreme purifier\"), purification sections of Tantras and Āgamas, ritual manuals detailing pavitra-prayoga",

In compounds: param-ātman (supreme Self), param-brahman (supreme Brahman), param-śānti (supreme peace). Para- as prefix means \"beyond\" or \"highest.\"\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Paraṃ indicates Brahman in its absolute, unmanifest aspect (nirguṇa-brahman) as distinct from the manifest aspect (saguṇa-brahman/apara-brahman); it is tat (That) which is pointed to but never grasped; the param-tattva is the ultimate principle beyond the 36 tattvas of manifestation; all emanation comes from paraṃ and returns to paraṃ, yet paraṃ itself is never affected or changed\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: The goal of all yogic practice is to realize paraṃ; in kuṇḍalinī yoga, the ascent through cakras leads finally beyond them all to param-ākāśa (supreme space) or param-śiva (supreme consciousness); meditation progresses from gross to subtle to paraṃ (the transcendent); the breath dissolves into prāṇa, prāṇa into mind, mind into consciousness, consciousness into paraṃ\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Para-śiva (supreme Śiva beyond form), Para-śakti (supreme power in its unmanifest state), Para-vāk (supreme speech/silence beyond sound); in Śrī-vidyā, Para is the highest of the four levels of vāk (para, paśyantī, madhyamā, vaikharī); Devī in para form is beyond all attributes yet source of all\n- **Mantric Significance**: Para represents the unstruck sound (anāhata-nāda) beyond all articulated mantras; the silence from which and into which all mantras arise and dissolve; the practice leads from gross mantra-japa to subtle mental repetition to ajapa (spontaneous) to para (transcendent silence)\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Central to Vedantic teaching: the distinction between para (higher) and apara (lower) knowledge, with para-vidyā being direct realization of Brahman; \"tat paraṃ brahma\" (that supreme Brahman) is the ultimate reality; the famous teaching \"satyaṃ jñānam anantaṃ brahma\" defines Brahman as paraṃ; realization of paraṃ is mokṣa—recognizing one's identity with the absolute beyond all relative existence; paraṃ is neither sat nor asat, neither existent nor non-existent, but beyond both\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Cannot be represented as it is beyond all form; symbolically indicated by empty space, the void, infinite sky, or simply the absence of any image; in yantras, the bindu (central point) that contains all yet is beyond all\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Pervasive throughout Upaniṣads (Muṇḍaka's para/apara distinction, Kaṭha's param-pada, Māṇḍūkya's turīya as paraṃ), Bhagavad Gītā (VIII.21, XV.6 on param-dhāma/param-pada), Yoga Vāsiṣṭha extensively on param-ātman and param-tattva, Brahma Sūtras on para-brahman, throughout Advaita literature as the technical term for the absolute",

The core Vedantic realization: jīva and Brahman are one. Aikya = oneness, from eka (one).\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Paramātmanor-aikya is the ultimate metaphysical truth—the recognition that individual consciousness and universal consciousness are not two; the apparent multiplicity of souls is māyā; in reality, only the one ātman exists, appearing as many through the limiting adjuncts (upādhis) of bodies and minds; this aikya was never absent, only unrecognized\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: All yoga practices aim at this realization; as kuṇḍalinī ascends and consciousness expands, the sense of individual boundary dissolves until paramātmānor-aikya is realized; in samādhi, the distinction between meditator, meditation, and meditated-upon collapses into the recognition of aikya; the yogi realizes \"I am not this limited jīva but the infinite paramātman\"\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: The realization that the deity worshipped and the worshipper are ultimately one; Śiva and the individual consciousness (Śiva-jīva-aikya) are non-different; the devotee discovers themselves to be that which they sought\n- **Mantric Significance**: Mantra practice leads to this recognition—the sound, its meaning, the speaker, and the ultimate reality pointed to are all one; the realization of śabda-brahma-aikya (identity of sound and Brahman) culminates in paramātmanor-aikya\n- **Dharmic Significance**: This is the supreme knowledge (para-vidyā) that liberates; the direct, immediate, irrefutable recognition of aikya is mokṣa; it is not becoming something new but recognizing what always is; the mahāvākyas declare this identity, the guru points to it, contemplation reveals it, and in the moment of paramātmanor-aikya, all seeking ends because the seeker realizes their identity with the sought; this is not union (which implies two becoming one) but recognition of ever-present non-duality\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Symbolized by the wave realizing its identity with the ocean, the space in the pot recognizing its oneness with infinite space, the gold in all ornaments being one, the dreamer awakening to realize all dream-characters were their own consciousness\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Central teaching throughout Upaniṣads (especially \"tat tvam asi\" of Chāndogya, \"aham brahma asmi\" of Bṛhadāraṇyaka, \"ayam ātmā brahma\" of Māṇḍūkya), Yoga Vāsiṣṭha's extensive elaboration of jīva-Brahman aikya, Vivekacūḍāmaṇi verses on ātma-anātma-viveka leading to aikya-jñāna, Aparokṣānubhūti on direct realization of identity, Aṣṭāvakra Gītā's proclamations of aikya, entire Advaita Vedanta tradition centers on this recognition",

The ultimate Self as opposed to jīvātman (individual self). In Advaita, these are ultimately identical, but paramātman emphasizes the universal aspect. The goal is realizing \"jīvātman = paramātman.\"\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Paramātman is Brahman considered as the inner essence (pratyag-ātman) of all beings; it is the one reality appearing as many through māyā; all jīvas are paramātman limited by upādhis (adjuncts); in creation, paramātman doesn't actually become many—the one Self is reflected in countless bodies like the sun in many pots of water, yet remains one; paramātman is sat-cit-ānanda (existence-consciousness-bliss) absolute, the ground and source of all existence\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: The goal of all yoga is paramātman-sākṣātkāra (direct realization of the supreme Self); through meditation, the sense of identification shifts from body (dehātman) to mind (jīvātman) to the recognition of paramātman; realizing \"I am not this limited self but the infinite paramātman\" is liberation; in samādhi, individual awareness dissolves/expands into paramātman\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Paramātman is Īśvara (personal God) from the cosmic perspective, Brahman from the absolute perspective; in bhakti, devotion to God leads to the recognition that the worshipper's true Self is identical with the deity—both are paramātman; the antaryāmin (inner controller) described in Upaniṣads is paramātman\n- **Mantric Significance**: Mantras like \"So'ham\" (I am That) and \"Aham brahma asmi\" (I am Brahman) are declarations of identity with paramātman; all deity mantras ultimately point to realizing paramātman; the practice progresses from honoring external deity to recognizing the deity as one's own paramātman\n- **Dharmic Significance**: The central teaching of Advaita Vedanta: jīvātman and paramātman are non-different; the apparent difference is due to avidyā (ignorance) and upādhis (limiting adjuncts); realizing \"I am paramātman\" is not becoming something new but recognizing what always is; this is aparokṣānubhūti (immediate experience), not intellectual knowledge; the mahāvākyas (\"tat tvam asi,\" \"aham brahma asmi\") reveal jīva-paramātman-aikya (identity); Self-inquiry (ātma-vicāra) leads to this recognition; liberation (mokṣa) is knowing oneself as paramātman\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Cannot be pictured as paramātman is formless (nirākāra) and without attributes (nirguṇa); symbolically represented as the Self in the cave of the heart (hṛdaya-guha), as infinite space (param-ākāśa), as pure light (jyoti-svarūpa); the ātman symbol ॐ represents paramātman\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Central throughout all Upaniṣads (Kaṭha, Muṇḍaka, Śvetāśvatara, Bṛhadāraṇyaka use paramātman extensively), Bhagavad Gītā distinguishes kṣara (perishable), akṣara (imperishable), and puruṣottama/paramātman (XV.16-18), Yoga Vāsiṣṭha's entire teaching centers on recognizing oneself as paramātman, Brahma Sūtras on paramātman-jīvātman relationship, all Advaita Vedanta texts, Yoga Sūtras reference to Īśvara as special puruṣa/paramātman",

Think: \"supremely worship-worthy.\" The gerundive -ya means \"to be done,\" so ārādhyā = \"to be worshipped.\"\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: In Śākta philosophy, the Divine Mother as paramārādhyā is the supreme reality (Para-śakti/Para-brahman in feminine form) who is both transcendent and immanent; She is the source of all deities, all worlds, all consciousness; worshipping Her as paramārādhyā is recognizing the feminine principle as ultimate\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: In tantric practice, the goddess worshipped in the sahasrāra or as kuṇḍalinī-śakti is paramārādhyā; bhakti directed to Her opens the heart-cakra and activates devotional energy; surrender to paramārādhyā dissolves ego and facilitates śakti-pāta (descent of grace)\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Primarily epithets in Śākta tradition—Tripurasundarī, Mahākālī, Mahālakṣmī, Mahāsarasvatī as paramārādhyā; also applied to Rādhā, Sītā, or any goddess form when addressed as supreme; represents the personal aspect of the absolute when conceived as feminine\n- **Mantric Significance**: Appears in dhyāna-mantras and invocations addressing the goddess; beginning worship with acknowledgment of the deity as paramārādhyā establishes the devotional relationship; in Śrī-vidyā, the central deity is paramārādhyā\n- **Dharmic Significance**: In bhakti-yoga, recognizing and worshipping the chosen deity (iṣṭa-devatā) as paramārādhyā cultivates complete surrender (śaraṇāgati/prapatti); the understanding that the goddess is both the means (upāya) and goal (upeya) of worship; philosophically, paramārādhyā represents Brahman with attributes (saguṇa-brahman) in feminine form, ultimately non-different from formless absolute (nirguṇa-brahman)\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Iconographically, the supreme goddess seated on throne or lotus, receiving worship from devotees and other deities; the Śrī-cakra/Śrī-yantra with the goddess at center represents paramārādhyā as the heart of reality worthy of supreme devotion\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Used in Devī Māhātmya, Lalitā Sahasranāma (where many epithets describe Devī as supremely worshipable), Devī Bhāgavata Purāṇa, Śākta Tantras, devotional hymns (stotras) to various goddesses, Śrī-vidyā literature describing the central goddess",

The \"ultimate meaning,\" \"absolute truth,\" or \"supreme purpose.\" Contrasted with vyavahāra (conventional reality). Paramārtha-satya = absolute truth.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Paramārtha is Brahman, the absolute reality that is the ground of all existence; while the world of names and forms (nāma-rūpa) is vyavahārika (conventionally real), paramārtha is the substratum—sat (pure being) without qualifications; in Madhyamaka Buddhism, paramārtha-satya (ultimate truth) is śūnyatā (emptiness); in Advaita, it is non-dual consciousness; paramārtha transcends subject-object duality\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: All yogic practices aim at paramārtha-darśana (vision of ultimate reality); the progression is from gross to subtle to paramārtha; in samādhi, vyavahāra dissolves and only paramārtha remains; realizing paramārtha is recognizing that consciousness alone is real, all else is appearance\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: From paramārtha perspective, all deity forms are vyavahārika (relative); the formless absolute (nirguṇa-brahman) is paramārtha; yet paradoxically, realizing any deity as one's own Self is approaching paramārtha; Īśvara from vyavahāra standpoint is Brahman from paramārtha standpoint\n- **Mantric Significance**: Mantras operate in vyavahāra but point to paramārtha; the progression from vaikharī (gross speech) through madhyamā and paśyantī to para (transcendent) represents moving from vyavahāra to paramārtha; ultimately, silence is paramārtha\n- **Dharmic Significance**: The central Vedantic distinction: vyavahāra-satya (practical/conventional truth) vs. paramārtha-satya (absolute truth); for daily life, vyavahāra operates (karma, dharma, relationships), but from paramārtha perspective, only Brahman is real, the world is mithyā (neither real nor unreal); realization involves understanding both levels—honoring vyavahāra while knowing paramārtha; this is jīvanmukti—living in vyavahāra while established in paramārtha; the supreme purpose (param-artha) of human birth is realizing paramārtha-satya\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Cannot be represented as paramārtha is beyond form; symbolically, the substrate behind all images, the screen behind all projections, the gold in all ornaments, the water in all waves\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Fundamental term in Nāgārjuna's Madhyamaka texts distinguishing saṃvṛti-satya and paramārtha-satya, extensively used throughout Advaita Vedanta (Śaṅkara's commentaries, Vivekacūḍāmaṇi, Pañcadaśī), central to Yoga Vāsiṣṭha's teaching on sat (real) vs. asat (unreal), Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra and other Mahāyāna texts, throughout Indian philosophical literature as technical term for \"absolute reality/truth\"",

Means \"from ultimate reality's viewpoint\" or \"absolutely speaking.\" Compare: vyavahārataḥ (conventionally), paramārthataḥ (ultimately).\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Paramārthataḥ indicates analysis from the non-dual perspective where Brahman alone is real; statements qualified by paramārthataḥ express ultimate truth: \"paramārthataḥ, the world is mithyā\" (from absolute standpoint, world is neither real nor unreal)\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: In meditation, shifting perspective from vyavahāra (where practice, practitioner, and goal seem separate) to paramārthataḥ (where all is recognized as one consciousness) is the culmination of sādhana\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Paramārthataḥ, all deity forms are recognized as appearances of the one formless reality; the distinction between worshipper and worshipped dissolves\n- **Mantric Significance**: Paramārthataḥ, the mantra, its meaning, the speaker, and the ultimate reality are non-different; all sound is vibration of one consciousness\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Central to Vedantic methodology: statements are qualified as vyavahārataḥ (true conventionally) or paramārthataḥ (true absolutely); for example: vyavahārataḥ, jīva undergoes rebirth; paramārthataḥ, there is no jīva, only Brahman; this two-truth framework allows honoring practical reality while teaching ultimate truth; enlightenment is living from paramārthataḥ while functioning in vyavahāra\n- **Symbolic Representation**: The ultimate vantage point, the view from the summit beyond all relative perspectives, seeing from infinity rather than from finite standpoint\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Standard adverb throughout Advaita Vedanta literature (Śaṅkara's bhāṣyas, Pañcadaśī, Vivekacūḍāmaṇi), Yoga Vāsiṣṭha's philosophical analyses, Madhyamaka texts distinguishing perspectives, used by all Indian philosophers when making statements from the absolute standpoint",

One of the six guṇas of Bhagavān. Think: absolute divine power and freedom. Related to īśvara (Lord).\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Paramaiśvarya is the supreme power through which Brahman manifests as Īśvara to create, sustain, and dissolve the universe; it is māyā-śakti under divine control; while paramātman is absolutely free (svatantra), paramaiśvarya is this freedom in action; in Kashmir Śaivism, svatantrya (absolute independence/freedom) is the essence of Śiva, which is paramaiśvarya\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: Through yoga, limited siddhis (powers) may arise, but paramaiśvarya is the unlimited power of the realized sage who is one with Īśvara; recognizing that all power is ultimately divine paramaiśvarya leads to surrender; in bhakti, meditating on the Lord's paramaiśvarya generates awe and devotion\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Viṣṇu is particularly associated with paramaiśvarya as the supreme controller (niyantā); Śiva as Maheśvara (great Lord) wields paramaiśvarya; Devī as Parā-śakti possesses paramaiśvarya as the dynamic power of Brahman; paramaiśvarya is what distinguishes Īśvara from jīva—complete control vs. apparent limitation\n- **Mantric Significance**: Mantras invoking divine paramaiśvarya acknowledge the deity's absolute power; surrender to this power (śaraṇāgati) is key in mantra-sādhana; the practitioner seeks grace from the one possessing paramaiśvarya\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Recognizing divine paramaiśvarya leads to surrender (prapatti) and humility; understanding that Īśvara has paramaiśvarya while jīva has limited power clarifies the distinction; yet in Advaita, upon realization, even this distinction dissolves—the jñānī recognizes their identity with the one who has paramaiśvarya; the eight aiśvaryas (aṇimā, mahimā, etc.) are limited powers, but paramaiśvarya is unlimited\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Symbolized by the cakra (discus) in Viṣṇu's hand, the triśūla (trident) in Śiva's hand, the divine throne, the cosmic sovereignty represented in iconography of deities ruling from their abodes\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Viṣṇu Purāṇa and Bhāgavata Purāṇa enumerate aiśvarya as one of Bhagavān's six qualities, Yoga Vāsiṣṭha discusses divine paramaiśvarya, Bhagavad Gītā (X.7, X.16-42, vibhūti-yoga) describes divine powers, Śaiva Āgamas on Śiva's paramaiśvarya, throughout devotional literature acknowledging supreme divine power",

The divine paradox: totally transcendent yet fully present. Bhagavad Gītā teaches Brahman as both para and apara prakṛti.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Parāpara describes the full reality of Brahman—as para, it is nirguṇa (without qualities), nirvikalpa (without modifications), transcending all creation; as apara, it is saguṇa (with qualities), the cause and substance of creation, Īśvara with attributes; this is not contradiction but completeness—the absolute is both utterly free of all limitations (para) and the essence within all forms (apara); in Bhagavad Gītā VII.4-5, Kṛṣṇa distinguishes his apara prakṛti (eightfold material nature) from para prakṛti (life principle, jīvas)\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: The yogi realizes parāpara—consciousness as both the witness beyond all experience (para) and the life-force within all experience (apara); meditation progresses toward para but discovers apara was never separate; the breath is apara, the awareness of breath is para, yet both are one\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Īśvara is parāpara—as Paramātman (para) utterly transcendent, as Antaryāmin (apara) the inner controller in all hearts; Śakti is parāpara—as Parā-śakti (para) the unmanifest power, as the manifest universe (apara); all deities embody this mystery of being both beyond form and in form\n- **Mantric Significance**: The mantra is apara (audible sound), its meaning/essence is para (transcendent); Om contains both—the sound (apara) and the silence it emerges from and returns to (para); sādhana involves honoring the apara form while seeking para reality\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Core Vedantic teaching: Brahman is neither exclusively nirguṇa (which would make it empty) nor exclusively saguṇa (which would make it limited), but parāpara—both/beyond both; this resolves apparent conflicts between schools emphasizing transcendence vs. immanence; the jñānī realizes the self as parāpara—the eternal witness (para) that is simultaneously the life in this body (apara); bhakti and jñāna are reconciled—devotion to the accessible form (apara) leads to the formless absolute (para) which was never separate\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Symbolized by the image of the ocean (para) and its waves (apara)—distinct yet not-two; the sun (para) and its rays (apara); the thread (para) running through beads (apara); cannot be depicted as it transcends visualization yet is every visualization\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Bhagavad Gītā (VII.4-5 distinguishes para and apara prakṛti, yet XIII indicates their non-difference), Yoga Vāsiṣṭha discusses parāpara nature of consciousness, Upaniṣads point to this mystery (Īśa balances transcendence and immanence), Śaṅkara's commentaries reconcile nirguṇa and saguṇa through parāpara understanding, Kashmir Śaivism's emphasis on Śiva as both transcendent and immanent",

Famous epithet of Śiva. Think: lord (pati) of all souls (paśus) bound in saṃsāra. Related to pāśa (bondage) and pati (master). Dative shows direction: offerings/devotion directed *to* Paśupati.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Paśupati represents the supreme consciousness (Śiva-tattva) in its role as liberator of bound souls; governs the relationship between paśu (individual soul bound by āṇava-mala, karma-mala, māyīya-mala), pāśa (bondage/fetters), and pati (lord)—the three fundamental categories of Śaiva philosophy\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Śiva as Paśupati—depicted in earliest Indus Valley seals in yogic posture surrounded by animals; one of the five primary aspects of Śiva (Sadyojāta, Vāmadeva, Aghora, Tatpuruṣa, Īśāna); venerated especially in the famous Paśupatināth temple in Nepal\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: In Śaiva sādhana, meditation on Paśupati represents recognition that one's individual consciousness (paśu-bhāva) is not separate from supreme consciousness; the yogi moves from identifying as paśu (bound animal nature) to recognizing identity with Paśupati (the lord/consciousness itself)\n- **Mantric Significance**: The pañcākṣara mantra \"Namaḥ Śivāya\" is essentially an offering to Paśupati; Vedic śatarudrīya hymn addresses Rudra-Paśupati repeatedly\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Liberation (mokṣa) in Śaivism is the recognition that paśu and Pati were never truly separate—the bound soul realizes itself as Śiva; devotion (bhakti) to Paśupataye is the path of recognizing the lord as both transcendent protector and one's own innermost Self\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad, Śaiva Āgamas, Paśupata Sūtras, Rudra hymns of Yajurveda, Śiva Purāṇa",

Common in teachings: \"paṇḍitāḥ paśyanti\" (the wise see), \"jñānīs paśyanti\" (the knowers perceive). The plural often indicates the consensus of realized beings.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: In tantric śabda-brahman (word as Brahman) theory, paśyanti is one of the four levels of vāc (speech/manifestation): para (supreme unmanifest), paśyantī (seeing/visionary), madhyamā (subtle/mental), vaikharī (gross/spoken); paśyantī-vāc is the level where undifferentiated consciousness first \"sees\" differentiation arising, though still in subtle unified vision before actual separation\n- **Mantric Significance**: Paśyantī as a level of vāc represents the stage where mantras exist in visionary form—seen as light or subtle vibration before becoming audible sound; yogis develop access to paśyantī level where all language is perceived in its archetypal, pre-differentiated unity\n- **Dharmic Significance**: When used as simple verb (they see), emphasizes that all realized beings paśyanti the same truth—\"ekam sat viprā bahudhā vadanti\" (truth is one, the wise speak of it in many ways)—they all see the same reality though expressing it differently; represents inter-subjective validation of spiritual realization\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Vāc-theory texts (Tantrasāra, Tantraloka); as verb: Bhagavad Gītā, Upaniṣads, Yoga Vasishtha",

Feminine nominative of participle paśyat. In vāc theory: para (beyond) → paśyantī (seeing) → madhyamā (middle) → vaikharī (manifest). Remember: paśyantī is where consciousness *sees* what will be spoken but hasn't yet spoken it—like seeing the whole meaning in a flash before finding words.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: In the four-level vāc (speech) cosmology: (1) parā-vāc—supreme undifferentiated word-consciousness in Brahman; (2) paśyantī-vāc—the \"seeing\" level where Śakti first beholds the seed-forms (bīja) of manifestation while still in unified vision, associated with buddhi-tattva or vijñāna; (3) madhyamā-vāc—subtle mental speech; (4) vaikharī-vāc—gross audible speech\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: Paśyantī corresponds to the subtle visionary state accessed in deep meditation where one \"sees\" truths holistically before they crystallize into thoughts or words; associated with ājñā-cakra; yogis cultivate access to paśyantī level to perceive the archetypal patterns behind manifest forms\n- **Mantric Significance**: At paśyantī level, mantras exist as luminous seed-visions (sphuṭa-nāda)—not yet audible but visible to inner sight as patterns of light and subtle vibration; the level where all language is one continuous seeing; mantra-sādhana aims to access this unified pre-verbal wisdom\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Represents prajñā-śakti (wisdom-power) in its immediate intuitive mode—direct seeing before conceptual division; the flash of recognition that precedes analysis; in Vedāntic terms, the buddhi operating at its subtlest, most unified level of perception\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Tantrasāra, Tantraloka (Abhinavagupta), Vākyapadīya (Bhartṛhari), Kashmir Śaiva texts, Śrī Vidyā literature",

From √pad (to go)—the foot is what you go with. Multiple meanings require context: catur-pāda = four feet/quarters; śloka-pāda = verse quarter (line); viṣṇu-pāda = Viṣṇu's feet. Remember: pada (foot/word) vs. pāda (foot/quarter) distinguished by vowel length.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: The cosmic manifestation conceived as having pādas (quarters/foundations): the famous Puruṣa Sūkta describes three-quarters (tri-pāda) of Puruṣa as immortal in heaven, one quarter (eka-pāda) as mortal creation; brahma-pāda = Brahman's quarter/realm; represents division of reality into levels or supports\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: In prāṇāyāma, measured in pādas (units); the feet (pādas) in āsana provide literal grounding; mūlādhāra-cakra at base is the pāda (foundation) of kuṇḍalinī's ascent; meditation on guru's or deity's feet cultivates humility and receptivity\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Śrī-pāda (holy feet) central to bhakti—taking refuge in Kṛṣṇa's feet, Rāma's feet, guru's feet; Viṣṇu-pāda (Gaṅgā originating from Viṣṇu's foot); pāda-pūjā (worship of feet) as act of supreme devotion; in iconography, divine feet often marked with auspicious symbols\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Dharma described as having four pādas in Satya Yuga, degrading to three, two, one in subsequent yugas; in Yoga Sūtras context, practice stands on multiple pādas (supports); prostration at pādas represents ego-dissolution\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Puruṣa Sūkta (Ṛg Veda 10.90), Upaniṣads (brahma-pāda), Bhāgavata Purāṇa (devotion to Kṛṣṇa's feet), all Sanskrit poetry (pāda as metrical unit)",

Locative indicates \"in/at/upon\" so pāpe = \"in the state of sin.\" Contrasted with puṇye (in merit). Common phrase: pāpa-puṇya (sin and merit, the dual results of action). Remember: pāpa (evil deed) vs. pāpin (evil-doer). Locative -e ending standard for neuter -a stems.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Pāpa represents actions that disturb ṛta (cosmic order) and generate negative karma; creates saṃskāras (impressions) that perpetuate bondage; in the cosmic moral economy, pāpa produces inevitable suffering as restoration of balance\n- **Dharmic Significance**: In Advaita Vedānta, pāpa-puṇya (sin-merit duality) are relative concepts applicable to the empirical realm but transcended by jñāna; both bind consciousness to karmic cycles; the jñānī is neither pāpakṛt (sin-doer) nor puṇyakṛt (merit-doer) but beyond both; however, for spiritual aspirants, avoiding pāpa and cultivating puṇya creates conducive conditions for liberation; pāpa fundamentally arises from avidyā (ignorance) and ahankāra (ego) which create separation and selfish action\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Dharma Śāstras (classification of pāpa), Bhagavad Gītā (especially BG 4.37: \"jñāna-agniḥ sarva-karmāṇi bhasma-sāt kurute\"—the fire of knowledge burns all karma/pāpa to ashes), Yoga Vasishtha, Upaniṣads",

Dvandva (copulative) compound meaning \"anus-and-genitals.\" Related to apāna-vāyu control in prāṇāyāma. Context: yogic physiology and control of lower functions. Remember: upastha literally \"standing near/below\"—euphemistic anatomical term.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: These organs governed by apāna-vāyu (downward/outward prāṇa) seated in mūlādhāra region; in haṭha-yoga, practices like mūla-bandha and aśvinī-mudrā involve conscious control of these regions to reverse apāna's natural downward tendency, redirecting energy upward for kuṇḍalinī awakening; brahmacarya (celibacy/retention) requires mastery over upastha; śauca (purity) extends to proper functioning and cleanliness of pāyu\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Represents the physical-biological level of existence that must be neither obsessively controlled nor carelessly indulged; in brahmacarya discipline, upastha control conserves ojas (vital essence) for spiritual transformation; the yogi recognizes even elimination (pāyu function) as divine process but is not identified with or attached to bodily functions\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā, Gheraṇḍa Saṃhitā (mudrās and bandhas), Caraka Saṃhitā and Suśruta Saṃhitā (Āyurvedic physiology), discussions of brahmacarya in Upaniṣads and dharma texts",

Pārada literally \"giver of crossing/liberation\"—mercury as alchemical transformer. In rasaśāstra, pārada is king of metals, associated with Śiva. Instrumental -ena shows means: \"by means of mercury.\" Related: pārada-baddha (fixed mercury), rasa (mercury/fluid/essence).\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: In tantric cosmology, pārada represents Śiva-tattva (Śiva principle) while sulfur (gandhaka) represents Śakti; their union in alchemy mirrors cosmic Śiva-Śakti union; mercury's ability to amalgamate with other metals symbolizes Śiva's all-pervading nature\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: Haṭha-yogic and rasāyana practices using pārada aim at kāya-kalpa (bodily rejuvenation) and deha-siddhi (bodily perfection); properly processed mercury (śodhita-pārada) used in compounds believed to stabilize bindu (vital essence), strengthen ojas, and prepare body for advanced prāṇic practices; mercury's fluidity parallels the yogi's goal of making the body fluid/subtle enough for immortality\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Pārada associated with soma (moon/nectar) and Śiva; mercury liṅgas (pārada-liṅga) considered especially powerful for worship; in iconography, Śiva sometimes depicted holding or associated with mercury\n- **Dharmic Significance**: The alchemical quest using pārada represents external counterpart to internal yogic transformation—both aim at transcending death and achieving liberation; the fixing of volatile mercury (sūta-bandhana) parallels the fixing of volatile mind (citta-sthairya)\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Rasārṇava, Rasaratna-samuccaya, Rasendramangala, and other rasaśāstra texts; Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā mentions mercury practices; tantric texts on kāya-sādhana",

  "पुण्य": "# पुण्य\n**Transliteration**: puṇ-ya\n**POS**: adjective (all genders); also noun (neuter nominative/accusative singular)\n\n**Root Analysis**:\n- √पु (pu) – \"to purify, cleanse, make pure\" + न्य (nya) adjectival suffix = पुण्य (puṇya) \"pure, purifying, meritorious, virtuous\"\n- As noun (neuter): पुण्यम् (puṇyam) \"merit, virtue, good karma\"\n\n**Meanings**:\n- Literal: pure, holy, sacred, auspicious, virtuous, meritorious; as noun: merit, virtue, good karma, religious merit\n- Contextual: in karma theory, puṇya refers to positive karmic accumulation from dharmic actions—opposite of pāpa (sin/demerit); puṇya creates favorable circumstances, happiness, and higher births; in popular religion, puṇya earned through charity (dāna), pilgrimage (tīrtha-yātrā), ritual (yajña), service; in philosophical texts, puṇya-pāpa are relative dualities to be transcended\n- Symbolic: represents the purifying power of aligned action; that which uplifts consciousness toward sattva (purity) and away from tamas (darkness); yet even puṇya binds—golden chains are still chains\n\n**Learning Tip**:\n- \"Puṇya\" = pure/merit (from √pu to purify + nya suffix). Contrasted with pāpa (sin): pāpa-puṇya = sin-and-merit duality. As adjective: puṇya-kṣetra (holy place), puṇya-karma (meritorious deed). As noun: puṇyam icchati (desires merit). Remember: even puṇya binds according to Vedānta—must transcend both pāpa and puṇya for mokṣa.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Puṇya represents sattvic karmic energy that moves consciousness upward through lokas (realms); accumulation of puṇya creates sukha (happiness/pleasure) as karmic fruit and facilitates birth in favorable circumstances; in cosmic accounting, puṇya balances against pāpa, determining one's trajectory through saṃsāra\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: Cultivation of puṇya through yama-niyama (ethical restraints and observances) purifies citta (mind-stuff), making it fit vessel for higher practices; puṇya creates the adhikāra (qualification) and favorable conditions (sat-saṅga, health, leisure) necessary for spiritual pursuit; however, attachment to puṇya or pride in virtue obstructs liberation\n- **Dharmic Significance**: The puṇya-pāpa framework governs moral causality in empirical realm; for householders (gṛhasthas), accumulating puṇya through dharmic living prepares ground for renunciation; for jñānīs, the teaching is that jñāna burns both puṇya and pāpa equally—\"ubhe sukṛta-duṣkṛte vidhunute\" (shakes off both good and evil deeds); the liberated one transcends puṇya-pāpa duality, acting spontaneously without karmic binding; yet paradoxically, the jñānī's actions appear as supreme puṇya from relative viewpoint\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Bhagavad Gītā (especially BG 9.21 on puṇya exhaustion), Yoga Sūtras (śukla-kṛṣṇa karma), Dharma Śāstras (puṇya-karma classification), Upaniṣads (transcending puṇya-pāpa), Yoga Vasishtha",
  "पुत्र": "# पुत्र\n**Transliteration**: put-ra\n**POS**: noun (masculine, nominative singular)\n\n**Root Analysis**:\n- Traditional etymology (nirukta): पुत् (put) \"a hell named Put\" + त्र (tra) from √त्रै (trai) \"to protect, save\" = पुत्र (putra) \"one who protects/saves from Put hell\"\n- Alternative: possibly from √पू (pū) \"to purify\" + त्र (tra) suffix = \"purifier\"\n- Folk etymology emphasizes son's role in performing śrāddha rites that save ancestors from suffering\n\n**Meanings**:\n- Literal: son, male offspring, child, descendant\n- Contextual: in Dharma Śāstra context, putra is essential for continuing lineage and performing ancestral rites (śrāddha, tarpaṇa) that liberate pitṛs; extends to adopted son (dattaka-putra), spiritual son (dharma-putra), disciple as spiritual son; in Yoga Vasishtha, Rāma is putra to Daśaratha and spiritual putra to Vasiṣṭha\n- Symbolic: represents continuity, legacy, and responsibility; in spiritual sense, realization or enlightened understanding as \"putra\" born from jñāna; the inner \"son\" of awareness born from spiritual practice\n\n**Learning Tip**:\n- \"Putra\" = son. Traditional etymology: put (hell) + tra (protector) = \"savior from hell\" through ancestral rites. Related: putrikā (daughter), putrī (daughter), putra-kāma (desiring a son). Compounds: mahā-putra (great son), dharma-putra (righteous son, also name of Yudhiṣṭhira). Remember folk etymology connects son to ancestral salvation.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: In pitṛ-pakṣa cosmology, putras perform śrāddha that sustains ancestors in pitṛ-loka and facilitates their eventual liberation or good rebirth; represents continuity of dharmic transmission across generations; the putra continues yajña, learning, and dharma of lineage\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Having putra is traditionally considered dharmic duty (pitṛ-ṛṇa repayment) and ensures continuation of family dharma; however, Yoga Vasishtha and Advaita texts emphasize jñāna-putra (son of wisdom) over biological putra—one's true \"offspring\" is realized understanding; in guru-śiṣya tradition, the disciple as spiritual putra carries forward the teaching lineage; the \"sonship\" to be cultivated is recognizing one's identity as putra of Brahman, offspring of immortal consciousness\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Dharma Śāstras (Manu Smṛti on putra duties), Śrāddha sections of Gṛhya Sūtras, Mahābhārata, Rāmāyaṇa, Yoga Vasishtha (Rāma as putra to both father and guru)",

Full form likely: pum (male/masculine) + prakṛti (nature/primal matter). In Sāṃkhya: Puruṣa (witness/masculine metaphorically) vs. Prakṛti (active/feminine metaphorically)—though Puruṣa is technically genderless consciousness. Context needed to determine precise meaning. Related: puṃs (person/male), prakṛti (nature), strī-prakṛti (female nature).",
  "पुरा": "# पुरा\n**Transliteration**: pu-rā\n**POS**: indeclinable adverb (avyaya)\n\n**Root Analysis**:\n- Possibly from पुर (pura) \"front, before\" + आ (ā) suffix = पुरा (purā) \"in front (in time), before, formerly\"\n- Functions as temporal adverb indicating past time\n- Related to पुरस् (puras) \"before, in front\"\n\n**Meanings**:\n- Literal: formerly, previously, in ancient times, in the past, once upon a time, long ago\n- Contextual: in narrative texts (especially Purāṇas and epics), purā introduces stories from ancient times—\"purā there was a king...\"; in philosophical discourse, purā can refer to primordial or pre-manifested states; often used to contrast past with present (purā...idānīm \"formerly...now\")\n- Symbolic: points to the eternal past, the timeless before, the original state; in cyclical time conception, purā refers to previous cycles, yugas, or kalpas; represents memory, tradition, and ancestral wisdom\n\n**Learning Tip**:\n- \"Purā\" = formerly, in ancient times. Indeclinable temporal adverb. Classic story opening: \"purā āsīt\" (there was formerly/once upon a time). Related: pura (before), puras (in front), pūrva (prior, eastern). Contrast: purā (formerly) vs. idānīm (now) vs. paścāt (later). Remember: Purāṇa = \"ancient (stories)\" from same root.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: In cyclical cosmology, purā points to previous manifestations—earlier yugas (Satya/Kṛta Yuga as the purā golden age), previous kalpas (cosmic days of Brahmā), or past manvantaras; represents the principle that what is now was purā in different form, and what will be was purā manifest—eternal recurrence\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Purā invokes authority of ancient revelation and precedent; śruti and smṛti preserve wisdom from purā; in Yoga Vasishtha particularly, stories from purā illustrate timeless truths about consciousness; the teaching that ātman is beyond time means purā-idānīm-paścāt (past-present-future) are ultimately illusory divisions in the eternal Now\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Opening word of countless Purāṇic and epic narratives, Yoga Vasishtha stories, Upaniṣadic dialogues set \"purā\"",
  "पुरुष": "# पुरुष\n**Transliteration**: pu-ru-ṣa\n**POS**: noun (masculine, nominative singular)\n\n**Root Analysis**:\n- Etymology debated; traditional nirukta: पुरि शयनात् पुरुषः (puri śayanāt puruṣaḥ) \"one who lies/dwells in the pura (city/body)\"\n- Alternative: पुर (pura) \"city, fortress, body\" + उष् (uṣ) from √वस् (vas) \"to dwell\" = \"dweller in the city (of the body)\"\n- Or from पुरि पूर्णं (puri pūrṇaṃ) \"that which fills the body/universe\"\n\n**Meanings**:\n- Literal: person, human being, man, male; cosmic being, primordial person\n- Contextual: In Sāṃkhya-Yoga philosophy, Puruṣa is the eternal consciousness principle—pure awareness (cit) distinct from Prakṛti (material nature); in Vedānta, identified with Ātman/Brahman; in Puruṣa Sūkta, the cosmic Person from whose sacrifice the universe manifests; in common usage, simply \"person\" or \"man\"\n- Symbolic: the witnessing consciousness that is never touched by prakṛtic modifications; the Self that dwells in but is not limited by the body-city; the eternal seer (draṣṭṛ) observing the dance of seen (dṛśya)\n\n**Learning Tip**:\n- \"Puruṣa\" = consciousness/person. Root meaning: \"dweller in the city (body).\" In Sāṃkhya: Puruṣa (consciousness) ≠ Prakṛti (matter/nature). In Vedānta: Puruṣa = Ātman = Brahman. Puruṣa Sūkta describes cosmic Puruṣa with thousand heads, eyes, feet. Remember: puruṣa-avatāra (divine incarnations), uttama-puruṣa (supreme Person), puruṣārtha (human goals).\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: In Sāṃkhya, Puruṣa is one of two fundamental tattvas—alongside Prakṛti; Puruṣa is pure consciousness (cit), unchanging (akṣara), inactive witness; Prakṛti is unconscious, ever-changing, active principle; liberation (kaivalya) is Puruṣa's realization of its distinction from Prakṛti; in Puruṣa Sūkta cosmogony, the cosmic Puruṣa is sacrificed by gods to create universe—his parts become all creation (mind from moon, eye from sun, etc.); represents both individual consciousness and cosmic consciousness\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: In Yoga Sūtras, liberation is puruṣa-khyāti (recognition of Puruṣa's true nature) achieved through puruṣa-prakṛti-viveka (discrimination between consciousness and nature); meditation cultivates draṣṭṛ-svarūpa (resting in seer's nature)—the Puruṣa; the yogi realizes: \"I am not body, mind, or experiences—I am Puruṣa, eternal witness\"\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Viṣṇu as Puruṣottama (Supreme Puruṣa); the Hiraṇyagarbha (golden womb/cosmic egg) as Puruṣa; in Vaiṣṇava theology, distinction between jīva-puruṣa (individual soul), kṣara-puruṣa (perishable being), akṣara-puruṣa (imperishable being), and Puruṣottama (Supreme Person/Kṛṣṇa)\n- **Dharmic Significance**: In Advaita, Puruṣa ultimately identical with Brahman—the non-dual awareness; the teaching is: realize yourself as Puruṣa (witness) not prakṛti (witnessed); the four puruṣārthas (human aims): dharma, artha, kāma, mokṣa—goals worthy of puruṣa; Puruṣa represents dignity, consciousness, and immortality of the Self\n- **Symbolic Representation**: In Puruṣa Sūkta imagery: cosmic being with thousand heads, eyes, encompassing all—three-quarters in heaven, one-quarter as manifest creation; Viṣṇu's cosmic form as Puruṣa\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Puruṣa Sūkta (Ṛg Veda 10.90), Sāṃkhya Kārikā, Yoga Sūtras (esp. on puruṣa-prakṛti distinction), Bhagavad Gītā (chapter 15 on Puruṣottama), Upaniṣads, Vedānta Sūtras",

Accusative shows direct object: \"I know *puruṣam*\" (I know the Puruṣa), \"meditate on *puruṣam*\" (meditate on Puruṣa). The anusvāra (ṃ) represents final -m before certain consonants. Common phrases: puruṣaṃ paśya (see the Puruṣa), puruṣaṃ viddhi (know the Person). Remember: ultimately Puruṣa is subject, not object—but practice treats it as object of contemplation.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Dharmic Significance**: The accusative puruṣaṃ in meditation contexts creates methodological duality—treating Puruṣa (one's own witnessing consciousness) as object to be known or realized; this is the upāya (means) that uses duality to reach non-duality; phrases like \"puruṣaṃ paśya\" (see the Puruṣa) or \"puruṣaṃ viddhi\" (know the Puruṣa) point consciousness toward its own source; the final realization transcends subject-object: one doesn't see puruṣam (Puruṣa-as-object) but realizes \"I am Puruṣa\"—the eternal subject that can never be objectified\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Puruṣa Sūkta (ya evaṃ vidvān puruṣam...), Bhagavad Gītā (puruṣottama chapter), meditation instructions in Upaniṣads and Yoga texts using puruṣam as object of dhyāna",

Genitive shows possession/relationship: \"puruṣasya guṇāḥ\" (qualities of Puruṣa), \"puruṣasya svarūpam\" (nature of consciousness).

Dual number in Sanskrit indicates exactly two. BG 15.16: \"dvāv imau puruṣau loke\" (these two puruṣas in the world: perishable and imperishable). Famous Upaniṣadic image: two birds (puruṣau) on one tree—one eating fruit (jīva), one watching (Brahman). Dual ending -au standard for -a stem masculines.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: In Sāṃkhya, infinite puruṣas exist—any two would be puruṣau; each is eternally distinct consciousness-principle; in Bhagavad Gītā 15.16-18, the dvau puruṣau (two puruṣas) are kṣara (all perishable beings) and akṣara (the imperishable Brahman), both transcended by uttama-puruṣa/puruṣottama (Kṛṣṇa as Supreme); represents levels of reality—empirical multiplicity and transcendent unity\n- **Dharmic Significance**: The Upaniṣadic teaching of \"dvā suparṇā sayujā sakhāyā\" (two birds, closely linked companions) describes jīva and Īśvara as puruṣau—both dwelling in the body-tree; one (jīva) eats the sweet and bitter fruits (experiences karma), the other (Brahman) merely witnesses without eating; meditation on this image reveals that the \"two\" are actually one—jīva's true nature is Brahman; Advaita teaches that puruṣau (the apparent two) are abheda (non-different) when rightly understood; the experience of duality is avidyā, the reality is non-dual consciousness\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Bhagavad Gītā 15.16-18 (kṣara-akṣara-uttama puruṣa teaching), Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad 3.1.1 and Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 4.6-7 (two-birds imagery), Sāṃkhya Kārikā (plurality of puruṣas)",

From puras (before/in front) + hita (placed). The purohita is literally \"placed in front\"—standing before the deity on behalf of the patron. Related: purohita (singular priest), rāja-purohita (royal priest), kula-purohita (family priest). Famous purohitas: Vasiṣṭha (purohita of Ikṣvāku dynasty), Bṛhaspati (purohita of the gods). Plural -āḥ standard for masculine -a stems.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Purohitas function as human representatives before divine powers and divine representatives before humans; in Vedic cosmology, Bṛhaspati serves as deva-purohita (priest of the gods), while Śukra serves as asura-purohita (priest of the demons)—representing the cosmic principle that even divine beings require ritual specialists; purohitas maintain ṛta (cosmic order) through correct ritual performance\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Purohitas bear responsibility for accurate transmission of mantra, ritual procedure, and dharmic guidance; their pronouncements and ritual actions have binding spiritual authority; the relationship between patron and purohita is sacred—the purohita's spiritual power (brahma-tejas) protects and guides; in Yoga Vasishtha, Vasiṣṭha functions as purohita teaching Rāma dharma and jñāna; represents the guru principle in its ritual-priestly aspect, distinct from but related to the jñāna-guru (knowledge-teacher)\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Vedic Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas (purohita duties), Dharma Śāstras (qualifications and responsibilities), Rāmāyaṇa and Mahābhārata (Vasiṣṭha and other royal purohitas), Yoga Vasishtha",

Compound describes both the act and the object—flowers held in reverent añjali mudrā. Related: añjali (the gesture itself, also greeting), puṣpa-pūjā (flower worship), samarpayāmi (I offer). Practice: \"puṣpāñjaliṃ samarpayāmi\" (I offer flower-offering). Common in pūjā and devotional contexts.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: The añjali mudrā (hands joined at heart center) channels prāṇa and focuses devotional energy; raising puṣpāñjali overhead connects anāhata-cakra (heart) with sahasrāra (crown), symbolizing heart's devotion reaching toward divine consciousness; the act of releasing flowers represents surrender, letting go of ego to merge with beloved deity\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Puṣpāñjali embodies bhakti-yoga—the path of loving devotion; represents samarpan (complete offering/surrender) to Īśvara; BG teaches: \"patraṃ puṣpaṃ phalaṃ toyam...\" (leaf, flower, fruit, water)—simple offerings made with devotion are accepted; puṣpāñjali as upacāra (devotional service) purifies heart and cultivates prema (divine love); in guru-pūjā, offering puṣpāñjali symbolizes placing one's blossoming understanding at guru's feet\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Āgamic pūjā manuals, Bhagavad Gītā 9.26 (on devotional offerings), bhakti literature, temple worship procedures",

In prāṇāyāma, the three phases are: pūraka (in-breath), kumbhaka (holding), recaka (out-breath). Think: pūraka fills (pūr-) the lungs like filling a pot. Related: pūrṇa (full), prapūraka (complete filling). Remember the sequence: breathe IN (pūraka), HOLD (kumbhaka), breathe OUT (recaka).\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: Pūraka is first stage of prāṇāyāma where prāṇa-vāyu is consciously drawn in through nāḍīs; different techniques emphasize different nostrils (iḍā vs. piṅgalā), speeds, and depths; pūraka fills the prāṇa-maya-kośa (vital sheath) with energy, preparing for kumbhaka where prāṇa is distributed and assimilated; proper pūraka balances vāta-doṣa, oxygenates blood, and calms nervous system; in advanced practice, pūraka is visualization of cosmic prāṇa filling entire subtle body\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Pūraka symbolically represents śravaṇa (hearing) in jñāna-yoga—the receptive phase where teachings fill the mind; just as pūraka precedes kumbhaka (retention), hearing precedes manana (reflection) and nididhyāsana (meditation); represents the principle that one must first be emptied (through recaka/exhalation/vairāgya) to be filled with higher wisdom; the rhythm pūraka-kumbhaka-recaka mirrors cosmic cycles of creation-preservation-dissolution\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā (detailed pūraka instructions), Yoga Sūtras 2.49-51 (prāṇāyāma techniques), Gheraṇḍa Saṃhitā, Śiva Saṃhitā, various prāṇāyāma manuals",

Central to Īśā Upaniṣad opening: \"ॐ पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदं पूर्णात् पूर्णमुदच्यते । पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते ॥\" (That is full, this is full, from fullness comes fullness; taking fullness from fullness, fullness alone remains). Related: pūrṇatā (fullness), pūraka (filling), sampūrṇa (completely full). Remember: Brahman as pūrṇa = complete, needing nothing.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Pūrṇa is the fundamental characteristic of Brahman—absolute completeness/wholeness/perfection; the famous Īśopaniṣad śānti mantra teaches that both paraṃ brahman (transcendent) and aparaṃ brahman (immanent/manifest creation) are pūrṇa; the mathematical-metaphysical paradox: infinity (pūrṇa) minus infinity (pūrṇa) equals infinity (pūrṇa)—illustrating Brahman's inexhaustible nature; represents that reality is not deficient, not becoming, but always already complete\n- **Dharmic Significance**: The realization \"I am pūrṇa\" (aham pūrṇaḥ) is liberation—recognizing ātman's inherent completeness rather than seeking external fulfillment; all sādhana aims at removing the false sense of incompleteness (apūrṇatā) born from avidyā; the seeking itself implies \"I am incomplete\" which contradicts the truth \"I am always already pūrṇa\"; Vedānta teaches: you are not becoming pūrṇa through practices—you are discovering your nature as eternally pūrṇa; desire (kāma) arises from false apūrṇatā-buddhi (sense of incompleteness) which dissolves in ātma-jñāna\n- **Mantric Significance**: The pūrṇa-mantra from Īśā/Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣads is chanted as śānti-pāṭha (peace invocation) establishing the meditation on absolute completeness before and after Upaniṣadic study; meditating on \"pūrṇam\" as mahā-vākya shifts consciousness from sense of lack to recognition of wholeness\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Īśopaniṣad śānti mantra, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.1.1, Chāndogya Upaniṣad, Advaita Vedānta texts on Brahman's pūrṇatva, Yoga Vasishtha",

Remember: adaḥ = \"that\" (distant/transcendent), idam = \"this\" (near/immanent). Both are pūrṇa.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Establishes the fundamental Vedāntic teaching that both paraṃ brahman (transcendent, referred to as \"that\"—adaḥ) and aparaṃ brahman (immanent manifestation, referred to as \"this\"—idam) are pūrṇa (absolutely complete); this mantra is the mathematical-metaphysical foundation: infinity is complete, and manifestation (which comes from infinity) is also complete, yet infinity remains infinity\n- **Mantric Significance**: The pūrṇa-mantra (or śānti-pāṭha) is chanted before and after Upaniṣadic study to establish right understanding; begins with \"pūrṇam adaḥ\" pointing first to the transcendent absolute (\"that is full\"), then to immanent reality (\"this is full\"), teaching that duality of transcendent/immanent is resolved in recognizing both as pūrṇa; the mantra itself is considered a mahā-vākya (great statement) revealing non-dual truth\n- **Dharmic Significance**: \"Pūrṇam adaḥ\" teaches that ultimate reality (Brahman/ātman referred to as \"that\") is not becoming complete, not evolving toward completeness, but IS complete (pūrṇa) always already; this counters the sense of incompleteness (apūrṇatā) that drives saṃsāric seeking; meditation on \"that is full\" shifts identification from limited body-mind to recognition of one's true nature as the pūrṇa consciousness indicated by \"that\"\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Īśopaniṣad śānti mantra, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.1.1, studied and commented upon by all Vedānta ācāryas (Śaṅkara, Rāmānuja, Madhva, etc.)",

Gerund ādāya shows completed action before main verb. Context: \"pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya...\" (from fullness, having taken fullness...). Think: taking water from ocean—ocean remains full. Related: ādāna (taking), dāna (giving), √dā (to give/take). Gerund -ya/-tvā shows prior action.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Describes the relationship between Brahman and creation (sṛṣṭi)—the manifest universe is pūrṇam ādāya (fullness taken) from pūrṇasya (from fullness/Brahman), yet Brahman remains pūrṇa (full); resolves the apparent contradiction: how can the infinite produce the finite?—answer: both are pūrṇa (infinite/complete); Brahman's creative power (māyā-śakti) manifests worlds without Brahman becoming depleted or divided\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Teaches that creation is not privation or diminishment of Brahman; unlike material cause that gets used up (milk → yogurt), Brahman as both material and efficient cause (abhinna-nimitta-upādāna-kāraṇa) remains unchanged (avikāra) while producing all; \"pūrṇamādāya\" illustrates vivarta-vāda (apparent transformation theory) of Advaita—manifestation is apparent, not real modification of Brahman; also applies to jīva: though appearing as individual (pūrṇam ādāya from Brahman), jīva's true nature remains pūrṇa Brahman\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Īśopaniṣad śānti mantra, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.1.1, Śaṅkara's commentaries on pūrṇa mantra",

Passive -ya-te shows \"is spoken forth.\" Related: udaya (arising), vācya (to be spoken), ukta (spoken). The creative word brings forth manifestation.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Describes sṛṣṭi (creation/manifestation) as pūrṇam udacyate—fullness coming forth from fullness (pūrṇāt); unlike material causation where effect diminishes cause, here fullness produces fullness without loss; represents the principle that Brahman's creative manifestation (through śabda-brahman/word-Brahman or nāda/primordial sound) speaks forth the universe\n- **Mantric Significance**: The verb udacyate (is spoken forth) connects to vāc-tattva (speech principle) and śabda-brahman doctrine—reality is vibration/word; the universe udacyate (is uttered forth) by primordial OM or divine speech; in Vedic cosmogony, creation occurs through vāc (speech) of the divine—\"udacyate\" captures this; the passive voice indicates spontaneous manifestation, not effortful creation\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Part of teaching that creation is līlā (divine play) or svābhāvika (spontaneous) rather than purposeful making; pūrṇam udacyate (fullness is declared/emerges) suggests manifestation is expression/utterance of Brahman's nature, not construction from raw materials; for the spiritual aspirant, understanding that world udacyate (emerges) from pūrṇa (fullness) prevents viewing it as error or deficiency\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Īśopaniṣad śānti mantra, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.1.1, Vedic hymns on creative vāc (speech)",

Root √śiṣ (to remain/be left) with ava- = avaśiṣ (remnant, residue). But here: no diminishment—pūrṇa remains! Note: Common manuscript variant ब (ba) for व (va).\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: The climactic teaching of pūrṇa mantra—despite appearance of creation, transformation, multiplicity, only pūrṇa avaśiṣyate (fullness remains); Brahman never actually becomes, divides, or depletes; all apparent change is vivarta (illusory transformation) not pariṇāma (real transformation); like ocean remaining ocean despite waves arising—pūrṇam eva avaśiṣyate (fullness alone remains)\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Liberation (mokṣa) is recognizing that pūrṇam eva avaśiṣyate—only wholeness/Brahman truly exists; the multiplicity of jīvas, worlds, experiences is superimposition (adhyāropa) on pūrṇa; when rightly seen, pūrṇam alone was, is, and remains (avaśiṣyate); the \"eva\" (alone) negates reality of duality—not \"fullness and something else remain\" but \"fullness ALONE remains\"; for the jñānī, despite body-mind continuing, the recognition is: pūrṇam eva avaśiṣyate—I am That fullness which alone remains, unchanged by appearance of change\n- **Mantric Significance**: The pūrṇa mantra's power culminates in this declaration—after establishing both transcendent and immanent as pūrṇa, after showing fullness emerges from fullness, it concludes with the ultimate truth: pūrṇam eva avaśiṣyate—cutting through all conceptual elaboration to simple truth of inexhaustible wholeness\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Īśopaniṣad śānti mantra, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.1.1, foundational text for Advaita understanding of Brahman's avikāratva (unchangeability)",

In mantra: \"pūrṇāt pūrṇam udacyate\" (from fullness, fullness emerges). Ablative -āt shows source/origin: creation comes FROM (āt) fullness. Compare: tasmāt (from that), yasmāt (from which), kutas (from where). Remember: ablative answers \"from what?\" Standard -āt ending for neuter -a stems.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: \"Pūrṇāt\" establishes Brahman as both upādāna-kāraṇa (material cause) and nimitta-kāraṇa (efficient cause) of creation—world emerges pūrṇāt (from fullness), not from raw material that gets consumed; the ablative teaches: source is pūrṇa, effect is pūrṇa, yet source remains pūrṇa\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Understanding creation comes pūrṇāt (from fullness) prevents viewing world as mistake, fall, or evil; if source is pūrṇa, manifestation cannot be absolute deficiency; also prevents seeking external completion—you come FROM (pūrṇāt) fullness, you ARE that fullness, not something that must journey to reach fullness; in Advaita, recognizing \"I am pūrṇāt udacyate\"—I emerge from and am that very fullness\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Īśopaniṣad śānti mantra, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.1.1",

Compound: attainment of complete Self. From √labh (to gain). Related: lābha (gain), alābha (non-gain), prāpti (attainment). The supreme \"gain\" in Vedānta—but paradoxically, you don't gain what wasn't there; you recognize the pūrṇa-ātman you already are. Not acquisition but recognition.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Pūrṇātmālābha represents the culmination and true goal of all spiritual paths—not partial realization but complete (pūrṇa) recognition of ātman; however, Vedānta teaches this \"lābha\" (gain) is unique: you don't attain what you lack but discover what you are; the famous teaching \"tat tvam asi\" (you are That) means pūrṇa-ātman is your svarūpa (true nature), not a future goal; all sādhana removes āvaraṇa (covering) to reveal the ever-present pūrṇa-ātman; pūrṇātmālābha therefore = avidyā-nivṛtti (removal of ignorance), not something added to ātman\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: The yogic quest for pūrṇātmālābha involves progressive recognition through practices—from identification with annamaya-kośa (physical sheath) to recognition of ānandamaya (bliss sheath) to transcending all kośas to realize pūrṇa-ātman beyond all layers; in Yoga Sūtras terms, kaivalya (isolation/liberation) is the pūrṇātmālābha where Puruṣa recognizes its pūrṇa (complete) svarūpa distinct from prakṛti\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Upaniṣads (ātma-vidyā teachings), Bhagavad Gītā (especially chapters on jñāna-yoga), Yoga Vasishtha (on ātma-jñāna), Advaita Vedānta texts",

Related: purohita (priest), paurohitya-karma (priestly duties). Remember: -ya suffix creates abstract quality/office nouns.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Paurohitya represents the formalized transmission of dharma and ritual knowledge; purohitas holding paurohitya bear responsibility for maintaining ṛta (cosmic/ritual order) through correct performance; the paurohitya relationship involves mutual obligation—priest provides spiritual guidance, patron provides material support; in Yoga Vasishtha, Vasiṣṭha's paurohitya toward Ikṣvāku dynasty represents ideal of sage-counselor transmitting both ritual and jñāna to rulers\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Dharma Śāstras (on purohita duties), Epics (Rāmāyaṇa/Mahābhārata describing paurohitya relationships), Gṛhya Sūtras (ritual procedures), Yoga Vasishtha (Vasiṣṭha as purohita)",

Ablative shows source: light FROM illumination. Sandhi: -āt + jy- → -ājjy- with consonant doubling. Related: prakāśa (light/manifestation), jyotis (light/luminosity), prakāśana (illuminating). Remember: philosophical distinction between prakāśa (consciousness-light, illuminating principle) and jyotis (manifest light, what is illuminated).\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Philosophically distinguishes between prakāśa (the self-luminous consciousness, cit-śakti) and jyotis (manifest light/phenomena); all jyotis (manifest light) arises prakāśaṇāt (from the illuminating power of consciousness); sun, moon, fire are jyotis, but their capacity to illuminate derives from prakāśa-tattva (consciousness principle); as Kaṭha Upaniṣad states: \"na tatra sūryo bhāti...\" (there sun does not shine)—all luminaries shine by Brahman's light\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Teaching that external light (jyotis) is secondary, arising from prakāśa (consciousness-light); meditation shifts from perceiving jyotis (objects/lights) to recognizing prakāśa (the witnessing illumination itself); jyotirmaya-puruṣa (luminous person in the heart) is not made of jyotis but IS prakāśa—self-luminous consciousness from which all jyotis arises\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Upaniṣads on ātman as jyotiḥ (especially Bṛhadāraṇyaka 4.3), texts distinguishing prakāśa-vāda (consciousness as light) from mere physical luminosity",

Master √jñā: jānāti (knows), jñāta (known), jñātṛ (knower), jñeya (to be known).\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: In Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad's analysis of consciousness states, prajñā is the third state—consciousness in deep sleep (suṣupti), the causal state where all differentiation is resolved into undifferentiated awareness; it is also used generally for the wisdom-aspect of Brahman\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Prajñā is the discriminative faculty (viveka) that enables liberation—the direct recognition of one's true nature as Ātman/Brahman; in Yoga Vāsiṣṭha, prajñā is cultivated through inquiry (vicāra) and leads to the cessation of mental modifications; it is wisdom born of direct realization, not conceptual learning\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: In some traditions, personified as Prajñā-devī or associated with Sarasvatī (goddess of wisdom); in Buddhist tantra, Prajñāpāramitā is personified as the mother of all Buddhas\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad (prajñā as third state of consciousness), Bhagavad Gītā (sthita-prajña = one established in wisdom, chapter 2), Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras (Buddhist perfection of wisdom literature), Yoga Vāsiṣṭha (throughout as discriminative wisdom)",

Suffix -ādi is extremely common in Sanskrit to mean \"and so on\" or \"beginning with.\" Examples: devādi (gods and others), brahmādi (Brahmā and others), mantrādi (mantras etc.). When you see X-ādi, it means \"X and the rest\" or \"starting with X.\" Used in lists or enumerations to avoid repetition.

Means \"to be known\" or \"knowable.\" Gerundive suffix -ya (also -tavya, -anīya) expresses \"should be\" or \"can be\" done. Pattern: √jñā → jñeya (to be known), √kṛ → kārya/kartavya (to be done), √dṛś → draṣṭavya (to be seen), √śru → śrotavya (to be heard). Triad: jñātṛ (knower) — jñāna (knowing) — jñeya (known).

The name for the sacred syllable OM (ॐ). Why \"OM\"? Because it contains all sounds: A (throat/beginning), U (middle/sustaining), M (lips/ending)—the complete sonic spectrum. Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad analyzes OM in four parts (mātrās): A = waking, U = dream, M = deep sleep, silence after = turīya (fourth/transcendent). Master this: OM = praṇava = oṃkāra = akṣara (imperishable syllable).\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Praṇava is the primordial cosmic vibration (nāda) from which the entire universe emanates; it is the sonic form of Brahman—the sound that was \"in the beginning\" before all manifestation; cosmologically, praṇava is the first expression of consciousness as it moves toward differentiation\n- **Mantric Significance**: OM is the supreme mantra (praṇava-mantra), the bīja (seed) of all mantras; every Vedic recitation begins and ends with OM; it is considered sarva-mantra-pratiṣṭhā (the foundation of all mantras); the three mātrās A-U-M represent all triads (creation-preservation-dissolution, past-present-future, waking-dream-sleep, etc.)\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Meditation on praṇava is a direct path to realization; the sound OM is non-different from Brahman/Ātman—to know OM is to know the Self; praṇava-upāsanā (meditation on OM) dissolves the meditator into the infinite\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: Praṇava meditation involves chanting or mentally resonating OM while following the sound inward to its silent source; in Kuṇḍalinī yoga, OM vibrates through all cakras; the unstruck sound (anāhata-nāda) heard in deep meditation is related to praṇava\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Written as ॐ or ओम्, the praṇava symbol appears at the beginning of sacred texts, on temples, in yantras, and as a focus of meditation; the symbol itself contains deep symbolism of the cosmic principle\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad (entire text devoted to analyzing OM), Praśna Upaniṣad, Chāndogya Upaniṣad (oṃkāra sections), Kaṭha Upaniṣad, Bhagavad Gītā 8.13, Yoga Sūtra 1.27-28, Yoga Vāsiṣṭha (numerous references)",

Same word as प्रणवम् (accusative/object), just different case ending. Pattern: praṇavaḥ (nom.), praṇavam (acc.), praṇavena (inst.), praṇavāya (dat.), praṇavāt (abl.), praṇavasya (gen.), praṇave (loc.). When praṇava is the subject of a sentence, use praṇavaḥ. Example: praṇavaḥ sarvam = \"OM is everything.\" For full analysis of praṇava's meaning, see previous entry.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Praṇava is the primordial cosmic vibration (nāda) from which the universe emanates—the sonic form of Brahman\n- **Mantric Significance**: OM is the supreme mantra, the bīja of all mantras; the three mātrās A-U-M represent all triads in manifestation\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Praṇava is non-different from Brahman; meditation on OM leads directly to realization of the Self\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad (entire text on OM), Praśna Upaniṣad, Chāndogya Upaniṣad, Yoga Vāsiṣṭha, Bhagavad Gītā 8.13",

A-vyaya: a (not) + vi (prefix) + aya (from √i \"to go\") = \"not subject to going/change/decay\" = imperishable/unchanging. Also technical grammar term: avyaya = indeclinable word (particles, prepositions that don't change form). But philosophically: avyaya = eternal/imperishable. Common synonym: akṣara (a \"not\" + kṣara \"perishable\" = imperishable). Both terms (avyaya, akṣara) used for Brahman and OM in Upaniṣads.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Praṇava as avyaya represents the eternal vibrational ground of existence—while all manifest sounds are temporary modifications (vikāra), praṇava is the imperishable sonic essence (nityam akṣaram)\n- **Mantric Significance**: The teaching that OM is avyaya/akṣara (imperishable syllable) appears throughout Upaniṣads; it is the one sound that is eternal—meditation on this imperishable sound leads to the imperishable reality (Brahman)\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Identification of praṇava with the imperishable (avyaya/akṣara) points to its identity with Brahman—that which never changes, never perishes; realizing OM as avyaya is realizing one's own imperishable nature\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Kaṭha Upaniṣad 1.2.17 (akṣaram etad = this imperishable syllable OM), Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad (oṃkāra as the imperishable), Bhagavad Gītā 8.13 (akṣaram brahma = imperishable Brahman = OM)",

Accusative ending -am (masculine singular). Pattern: praṇavaḥ (nom.) → praṇavam (acc.). Accusative case answers \"what?\" as direct object. Examples: mantram japati (chants mantra), dharmam rakṣati (protects dharma), praṇavam upāste (worships OM). Common verbs taking accusative object: √jap (chant), √dhyai (meditate on), √upās (worship), √smar (remember), √bhaj (worship). This is identical to प्रणवम् entry from before.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Mantric Significance**: As accusative object, praṇavam represents the target of repetition (japa), meditation (dhyāna), and contemplation (upāsanā)—the sound-form toward which the practitioner directs attention\n- **Dharmic Significance**: The accusative \"praṇavam\" in meditation instructions points to OM as the ālambana (support/object) for consciousness—that on which awareness rests to transcend subject-object duality\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Yoga Sūtra 1.27-28 (tasya vācakaḥ praṇavaḥ—\"its [Īśvara's] designation is praṇava,\" taj-japaḥ—\"repetition of that [praṇava]\"), Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad, Kaṭha Upaniṣad 1.2.15-16 (describing meditation on praṇava as object)",

Pattern: X-traya = \"triad of X\" or \"threefold X.\" The praṇava-traya specifically refers to A-U-M analysis in Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: The praṇava-traya represents the threefold structure of manifest reality—all triads (creation-preservation-destruction, past-present-future, sattva-rajas-tamas, etc.) are encoded in the three mātrās A-U-M\n- **Mantric Significance**: A (अ akāra) = waking state/Vaiśvānara/gross; U (उ ukāra) = dream state/Taijasa/subtle; M (म makāra) = deep sleep/Prājña/causal. Together they constitute the complete spectrum of manifest sound and consciousness. The fourth (turīya) is the silence after/beyond the three\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Understanding praṇava-traya is understanding the structure of consciousness—the three states through which all experience occurs, and the recognition that all three arise in the witnessing awareness (turīya) that is one's true nature\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Often depicted as triangle with three corners (A-U-M) and central point (turīya/bindu), or as the ॐ symbol itself showing threefold structure\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad (entire text devoted to analyzing the praṇava-traya and its correspondence to states of consciousness), Praśna Upaniṣad 5 (praṇava analysis)",

Sandhi: ḥ + ch → ś. Chandas (neuter) means \"meter, Vedic prosody, rhythm.\" From √chad \"to please\" (that which pleases the ear = proper meter). Six Vedāṅgas include chandas (metrics). Famous meters: gāyatrī (24 syllables), anuṣṭubh (32), triṣṭubh (44).

Locative ending -e (masculine singular). Pattern: praṇavaḥ (nom.) → praṇave (loc.). Locative case answers \"where?\" or \"in what state?\" Examples: hṛdaye (in the heart), ātmani (in the Self), brahmaṇi (in Brahman), samādhe (in samādhi). Common construction: praṇave sthitaḥ/līnaḥ/layaḥ = \"established/absorbed/dissolved in OM.\" The locative expresses the interior space or state where consciousness rests.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Mantric Significance**: \"In praṇava\" (praṇave) indicates the deepest stage of mantra meditation—not merely repeating OM, but dwelling within its vibrational field; consciousness established in praṇave transcends the sound itself and rests in the silence that is its source\n- **Dharmic Significance**: The locative praṇave points to the teaching that OM is not just an object \"out there\" but the very ground in which consciousness dwells; to be \"in praṇava\" is to recognize one's own nature as the eternal sound-silence\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad (describing absorption in oṃkāra), Kaṭha Upaniṣad (dwelling in the imperishable syllable), Yoga Vāsiṣṭha (consciousness established in praṇava)",

Literally \"before the eye\" = \"directly perceived.\" Akṣa means eye/axis (from √akṣ to pervade/reach). Related: akṣi (eye), cakṣus (eye), apāṅga (corner of eye). Pratyakṣa is first of classical pramāṇas (means of knowledge): 1) pratyakṣa (perception), 2) anumāna (inference), 3) śabda (testimony). Opposite: parokṣa (indirect, beyond the eye = para + akṣa). Key distinction in philosophy: pratyakṣa (direct) vs. parokṣa (indirect). Aparokṣa = not indirect = direct (especially spiritual realization).\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Pratyakṣa in spiritual contexts refers to aparokṣa-jñāna—direct, immediate realization of Brahman/Ātman; not conceptual knowledge but lived experience; the goal is to make the teaching (śabda) become pratyakṣa (directly experienced); this is sākṣātkāra (direct realization)\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Nyāya Sūtra (defines pratyakṣa as primary pramāṇa), Yoga Sūtra (pratyakṣa as valid cognition), Vedānta texts (aparokṣa-anubhūti = direct experience), Yoga Vāsiṣṭha (pratyakṣa knowledge vs. conceptual understanding)",

Remember: prāṇa is both breath (physical) and life force (subtle). Five prāṇas (pañca-prāṇa): prāṇa (chest, inhalation), apāna (lower, excretion), samāna (navel, digestion), vyāna (all limbs, circulation), udāna (throat, speech). Prāṇa + āyāma (extension) = prāṇāyāma (breath control, fourth limb of Patañjali's aṣṭāṅga-yoga). Prāṇa + maya (made of) = prāṇamaya (vital, life-made) as in prāṇamaya-kośa (vital sheath, second of pañca-kośa). In compounds: prāṇa-vāyu (vital air), prāṇa-śakti (vital power), prāṇa-vidyā (science of life force). Mnemonic: \"Prāṇa\" sounds like \"prana\" (forward) + \"āna\" (breath) = forward breath = life force flowing forth.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Prāṇa is the universal vital principle (cosmic prāṇa, sūtrātman, or hiraṇyagarbha) that animates all living beings and pervades the cosmos; it is the dynamic principle of manifestation, the \"thread\" (sūtra) connecting all beings; on the individual level, prāṇa resides primarily in the prāṇamaya-kośa (vital sheath), the second of the five sheaths (pañca-kośa) covering the ātman; it mediates between the gross physical body (annamaya-kośa) and the mental sheath (manomaya-kośa), serving as the vital link between matter and mind\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: Central to prāṇāyāma (breath control), the fourth limb of Patañjali's aṣṭāṅga-yoga; by controlling breath, yogis regulate prāṇa, purify the nāḍīs (subtle channels), awaken kuṇḍalinī, and prepare the mind for dhāraṇā (concentration) and dhyāna (meditation); the five prāṇas (prāṇa, apāna, vyāna, samāna, udāna) govern specific bodily functions and regions; additionally, five subsidiary prāṇas (upa-prāṇa): nāga (belching), kūrma (blinking), kṛkara (sneezing), devadatta (yawning), dhanañjaya (pervades entire body even after death); prāṇa flows through 72,000 nāḍīs, primarily iḍā (left, lunar, cooling), piṅgalā (right, solar, heating), and suṣumnā (central, spiritual ascent); harmonizing prāṇa and apāna in the navel region ignites the inner fire (agni) and awakens higher consciousness\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Prāṇa is personified as Vāyu (wind god, deity of air and breath) or Prāṇa-deva; in the Upaniṣads, prāṇa is called the \"eldest and best\" (jyeṣṭha-śreṣṭha) among the faculties in the famous \"contest of the faculties\" (prāṇa-vidyā) where prāṇa demonstrates superiority over speech, eye, ear, and mind by showing that life ceases without it; cosmic prāṇa is identified with Hiraṇyagarbha (the golden womb, cosmic mind) or Sūtrātman (the thread-self connecting all beings)\n- **Mantric Significance**: \"Prāṇāya svāhā\" and \"prāṇāya namaḥ\" are mantras offered to the vital breath in homa (fire ritual) and nyāsa (ritual placement); the prāṇa-agnihotra (internal fire offering) visualizes breath as offering into the inner fire; OM itself is considered the sonic form of prāṇa, the vibratory life force; prāṇa-pratishṭhā mantras (\"installation of life force\") are used to animate temple mūrtis (consecrated images); in Vedic recitation, prāṇa sustains the sacred sound and maintains continuity of mantra\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Prāṇa is the fundamental link between body and consciousness; understanding and mastering prāṇa is essential for spiritual progress; the Upaniṣadic teaching \"prāṇasya prāṇam\" (the prāṇa of prāṇa, i.e., Brahman is the life of life itself) reveals that ultimate reality is the source and support of all vital energy; prāṇa is neither gross matter nor pure consciousness but the intermediate principle that allows consciousness to express through matter; control of prāṇa (prāṇa-saṁyama) leads to control of mind (citta); restraining prāṇa through prāṇāyāma removes the covering (āvaraṇa) obscuring the inner light (prakāśa) of consciousness\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Represented as wind, breath, life force flowing in wave patterns; visualized as subtle luminous currents flowing through nāḍīs; in yantras and iconography, prāṇa is shown as vāyu-maṇḍala (air region, smoky-gray, hexagonal); directional flow arrows in yogic diagrams indicate prāṇa movement; sometimes symbolized by birds or breath vapor\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Upaniṣads (especially Praśna Upaniṣad, Chāndogya Upaniṣad III.13-19 [prāṇa-vidyā], Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad I.3 [contest of faculties], Kaṭha Upaniṣad II.2.5, Taittirīya Upaniṣad II [prāṇamaya-kośa]); Yoga Sūtra of Patañjali (II.49-53 on prāṇāyāma); Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā (extensive prāṇāyāma techniques); Yoga Vasishtha (prāṇa and mind interdependence); Bhagavad Gītā (IV.29, V.27); Śiva Saṁhitā; Gheraṇḍa Saṁhitā; Āyurvedic texts (Caraka Saṁhitā, Suśruta Saṁhitā on prāṇa-vāyu)",

The -maya suffix pattern: anna (food) + maya = annamaya (made of food/physical body); prāṇa (life force) + maya = prāṇamaya (made of life force/vital sheath); manas (mind) + maya = manomaya (made of mind/mental sheath); vijñāna (knowledge) + maya = vijñānamaya (made of knowledge/intellectual sheath); ānanda (bliss) + maya = ānandamaya (made of bliss/bliss sheath). These five form the pañca-kośa (five sheaths) model in Taittirīya Upaniṣad. Remember: prāṇamaya-kośa is the second sheath, the vital energy body between physical (annamaya) and mental (manomaya). Mnemonic: \"maya\" = \"made of\" (think \"made ya\" → maya), so prāṇamaya = \"made of prāṇa\".\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Prāṇamaya represents the vital energetic dimension of existence, the second layer (kośa) in the five-sheath (pañca-kośa) model of Vedānta; while annamaya-kośa (food sheath) is the gross physical body, prāṇamaya-kośa is the subtle energetic body that animates it; this sheath consists of the five main prāṇas (pañca-prāṇa) circulating through 72,000 nāḍīs (subtle channels); it is the \"body\" of vital force that sustains life, maintains homeostasis, and links physical processes to mental states; cosmically, the individual prāṇamaya corresponds to the universal vital principle (sūtrātman, hiraṇyagarbha)\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: Prāṇamaya-kośa is the primary field of prāṇāyāma practice (breath control, fourth limb of aṣṭāṅga-yoga); by regulating breath, yogis directly influence this vital sheath, purifying nāḍīs, balancing prāṇa and apāna, and preparing for deeper meditative states; techniques like nāḍī-śodhana (alternate nostril breathing) purify the prāṇamaya level; in kuṇḍalinī yoga, awakening requires harmonizing prāṇa-apāna in the prāṇamaya-kośa to ignite the inner fire; this sheath bridges physical āsana practice and mental dhāraṇā (concentration); energy healing modalities (Reiki, pranic healing) work primarily at the prāṇamaya level\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: The prāṇamaya dimension is governed by Vāyu (wind god) in his life-sustaining aspect; the five prāṇas are sometimes personified as five forms of Vāyu; the cosmic prāṇa (hiraṇyagarbha) is the universal deity of the prāṇamaya realm; Hanumān, son of Vāyu, represents mastery over prāṇa (hence his ability to fly, change size, and display superhuman strength through prāṇa control)\n- **Mantric Significance**: Mantras combined with prāṇāyāma work directly on the prāṇamaya-kośa; the practice of ajapa-japa (spontaneous mantra repetition synchronized with breath: \"so\" on inhalation, \"ham\" on exhalation = so'ham \"I am That\") occurs in the prāṇamaya dimension; bīja mantras (seed syllables) like YAM (anāhata-cakra, air element) resonate with prāṇamaya; mantric prāṇa-pratishṭhā rituals install life force into images by invoking prāṇamaya presence\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Understanding prāṇamaya-kośa is crucial for Vedāntic discrimination (viveka): recognizing that \"I am not this vital sheath\" is part of the neti-neti (not this, not this) process leading to ātma-jñāna (Self-knowledge); the prāṇamaya level is where psychosomatic connections are most evident (anxiety affects breath, breath control calms mind); mastery of prāṇamaya gives control over involuntary processes and mental states; in jīvanmukti (liberation while living), the sage may appear to have prāṇamaya functions but remains unidentified with them\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Visualized as a luminous energy field or aura surrounding the physical body; depicted as flowing currents of light in yogic diagrams; the prāṇamaya-kośa is sometimes shown as a radiant second layer in depictions of the kośa system; in Tantric iconography, the vāyu-maṇḍala (air region, smoky-gray hexagon in the heart) represents the prāṇamaya dimension; breath visualizations in meditation depict prāṇamaya activity\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Taittirīya Upaniṣad (II.2, defining prāṇamaya-kośa as the second sheath within annamaya); Yoga Sūtra of Patañjali (II.49-53, prāṇāyāma practices working on prāṇamaya level); Pañcadaśī of Vidyāraṇya (detailed kośa analysis); Vivekacūḍāmaṇi of Śaṅkara (discriminating the kośas); Māṇḍūkya Kārikā; Yoga Vasishtha (prāṇa-mind interdependence); commentaries on Taittirīya Upaniṣad by Śaṅkara",

Sandhi rule: visarga (ḥ) before palatal च (ca) → श् (ś), so prāṇaḥ ca → prāṇaś ca. Pattern: any word ending in -aḥ + ca → -aś ca (e.g., मनः manaḥ + च ca → मनश्च manaś ca). The च (ca) is enclitic (attached to preceding word in pronunciation). Common pattern in Upaniṣadic enumeration: \"X, Y, prāṇaś ca\" = \"X, Y, and prāṇa\". Remember: visarga + palatal = ś (e.g., ḥ + c/ch/j/jh → ś). Compare: devaḥ ca → devaś ca; rāmaḥ ca → rāmaś ca.",

Pattern: X-saṃjñāka = \"having the designation X, known as X, technically termed X\". Examples: brahma-saṃjñāka (designated as Brahman), ātma-saṃjñāka (known as ātman). Saṃjñā (सम् sam together + √ज्ञा jñā to know = \"knowing together\" = agreed-upon name/designation/technical term). The -ka suffix makes possessive adjectives. Remember: saṃjñā = technical term/designation (used in grammar for technical nomenclature, e.g., saṃjñā-prakaraṇa = chapter on technical terms in Pāṇini).

Declension pattern for masculine a-stem nouns: singular prāṇaḥ (nom.), prāṇam (acc.) → plural prāṇāḥ (nom.), prāṇān (acc.). The five main prāṇas (pañca-prāṇa): (1) **prāṇa** (प्राण) – chest, inhalation, forward/upward; (2) **apāna** (अपान) – lower abdomen, exhalation/elimination, downward (apa = away/down); (3) **samāna** (समान) – navel, digestion, equalizing (sama = equal); (4) **udāna** (उदान) – throat, speech/ascent, upward (ud = up); (5) **vyāna** (व्यान) – whole body, circulation, pervading (vi + āna = spreading throughout).

The ādi (आदि) suffix = \"beginning with, et cetera, and others\" (common pattern in Sanskrit to indicate a representative list). Examples: devādi (gods et cetera), mantrādi (mantras and such), indriyādi (senses and others). Prāṇādi = \"prāṇa and the other vital airs\" = pañca-prāṇa (five prāṇas: prāṇa, apāna, samāna, udāna, vyāna). Pattern: X-ādi = \"X and others, beginning with X, X et cetera\". Remember: ādi marks the first/principal member of a group. Sandhi: prāṇa + ādi → prāṇādi (a + ā → ā). Mnemonic: ādi sounds like \"added\" → prāṇa and what's \"added\" to it (the other vital airs).",

Adhika (अधिक) = adhi (over/above) + √i (to go) or from adhi + ka = \"going beyond, exceeding, superior\". Pattern: X-adhika = \"superior to X, more than X, exceeding X\". Examples: rūpādhika (exceeding form), kālādhika (beyond time). Remember the kośa hierarchy: annamaya (food/physical) < prāṇamaya (vital) < manomaya (mental) < vijñānamaya (intellectual) < ānandamaya (bliss). Anything in higher kośas is adhika (superior) to lower ones. Mnemonic: \"adhika\" sounds like \"added-high\" → higher/superior/additional.",

Root √यम (yam) \"to restrain, control\" (same root as yama = restraint, first limb of yoga). Āyāma = ā (fully) + yam + a = complete restraint/extension. The eight limbs (aṣṭāṅga) of Patañjali's yoga: (1) yama (ethical restraints), (2) niyama (observances), (3) āsana (posture), (4) **prāṇāyāma** (breath control), (5) pratyāhāra (sense withdrawal), (6) dhāraṇā (concentration), (7) dhyāna (meditation), (8) samādhi (absorption). Three components of prāṇāyāma: pūraka (inhalation, from √pṝ \"to fill\"), kumbhaka (retention, from kumbha \"pot\"—holding breath like a pot), recaka (exhalation, from √ric \"to empty\"). Mnemonic: \"āyāma\" sounds like \"I am\" → \"I am (controlling) prāṇa\" = prāṇāyāma.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Prāṇāyāma works on the prāṇamaya-kośa (vital sheath), the second of five sheaths (pañca-kośa); it harmonizes individual breath with cosmic prāṇa (the universal life principle); the practice acknowledges that breath is not merely physiological but is the individualized expression of the cosmic breath (brahmāṇḍa-piṇḍa correspondence: macrocosm-microcosm); by regulating personal prāṇa, the yogī aligns with the cosmic rhythm of creation (sṛṣṭi-sthiti-laya: emanation-sustenance-dissolution) mirrored in inhalation-retention-exhalation\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: Fourth limb of aṣṭāṅga-yoga (Patañjali's eight-limbed path); purifies the 72,000 nāḍīs (subtle energy channels), especially the three primary channels: iḍā (left, lunar, cooling, connected to left nostril), piṅgalā (right, solar, heating, connected to right nostril), and suṣumnā (central channel for spiritual ascent); balances prāṇa-vāyu (forward-moving vital air) and apāna-vāyu (downward-moving vital air), causing their fusion in the navel region which ignites the inner fire and awakens kuṇḍalinī; prepares the body-mind system for pratyāhāra (sense withdrawal) and deeper meditative states; removes obstacles (āvaraṇa) obscuring the inner light of consciousness; regulates the five main prāṇas and five subsidiary prāṇas\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Prāṇāyāma is under the governance of Vāyu (wind god, deity of air and prāṣa); mastery of prāṇāyāma is associated with Hanumān (son of Vāyu) who exemplifies perfect prāṇa control (ability to fly, change size, etc.); the practice invokes and harmonizes with the cosmic Vāyu, the breath of Puruṣa that moves through all creation\n- **Mantric Significance**: Prāṇāyāma is often combined with mantra repetition (japa); the practice of so'ham ajapa-japa (spontaneous repetition of \"so\" on inhalation, \"ham\" on exhalation = \"I am That\") is a mantric prāṇāyāma; counting mantras (e.g., OM repetitions) to measure breath duration is traditional; the Gāyatrī mantra is recited during prāṇāyāma in Vedic practice; prāṇāyāma with bīja mantras (seed syllables) directs prāṇa to specific cakras; the practice itself is considered a form of internal fire offering (prāṇa-agnihotra)\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Yoga Sūtra II.52 states that prāṇāyāma destroys the covering (āvaraṇa) of the light (prakāśa), revealing the luminosity of consciousness; it prepares the mind for dharaṇā (concentration) by removing restlessness (vikṣepa); the interdependence of prāṇa and citta (mind) is fundamental: \"when prāṇa moves, citta moves; when prāṇa is still, citta is still\" (Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā); mastery of prāṇāyāma leads to mental stability, clarity, and the capacity for sustained meditation; it is essential for jīvanmukti (liberation while living) as it frees consciousness from identification with gross physiological processes\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Depicted as breath flowing through nāḍīs in yogic diagrams; visualized as luminous currents of energy; the kumbhaka (retention) phase symbolizes the cosmic suspension between creation and dissolution; prāṇāyāma is sometimes shown as bellows or wind instruments in iconography; in Tantric diagrams, the union of prāṇa and apāna is depicted as the awakening of kuṇḍalinī at the mūlādhāra-cakra\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Yoga Sūtra of Patañjali (II.49-53: definition, types, and effects of prāṇāyāma); Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā (Chapter 2: extensive prāṇāyāma techniques—nāḍī-śodhana, sūrya-bhedana, ujjāyī, śītalī, bhastrikā, bhrāmarī, mūrcchā, plāvinī); Gheraṇḍa Saṁhitā (Chapter 5: prāṇāyāma practices); Śiva Saṁhitā (Chapter 3: prāṇāyāma and cakras); Yoga Yājñavalkya; Gorakṣa Śataka; Bhagavad Gītā (IV.29, V.27: prāṇa-apāna offerings); Upaniṣads (references to breath control as spiritual practice)",

Turīya (तुरीय) = the fourth state beyond waking-dreaming-deep sleep (from Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad). Three states: (1) jāgrat (जाग्रत्, waking), (2) svapna (स्वप्न, dreaming), (3) suṣupti (सुषुप्ति, deep sleep), (4) turīya (तुरीय, the fourth, transcendent consciousness). Here applied to prāṇa: three ordinary prāṇic states vs. transcendent prāṇa-turīya. Ākhya (आख्य) from √ख्या (khyā, to tell/name) = \"called, named\". Locative -e = \"in, at, on\". Sandhi: prāṇa + u + vai → prāṇovai (a + u → o). Mnemonic: turīya = \"the fourth\" (like \"trio + one more\" = fourth state). Vai = \"verily, indeed\" (emphatic, like English \"veritable\").\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Prāṇa-turīya represents the transcendent vital principle (para-prāṇa, supreme prāṇa) that underlies and sustains the three ordinary states of vital activity; just as turīya consciousness (from Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad) is the substratum of waking, dreaming, and deep sleep, prāṇa-turīya is the unchanging witness of all prāṇic modifications; it is the cosmic life force (hiraṇyagarbha, sūtrātman) in its absolute, unmodified state; this state is beyond the five prāṇas, beyond inhalation-exhalation duality, beyond activity and rest\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: Accessed in kevala-kumbhaka (spontaneous breath retention) where breath naturally ceases without effort; in nirvikalpa-samādhi, prāṇa dissolves into turīya; advanced yogis abide in prāṇa-turīya even while the body continues automatic breathing (like turīya-consciousness persisting through all avasthās); this state represents the culmination of prāṇāyāma practice; when prāṇa and apāna merge completely in the suṣumnā and ascend to sahasrāra, prāṇa enters its turīya state\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Prāṇa-turīya corresponds to Īśvara or Hiraṇyagarbha as the cosmic life principle in its unmanifest, causal aspect; it is the prāṇa of Brahman (prāṇasya prāṇam, \"the prāṇa of prāṇa\" from Kena Upaniṣad I.2); beyond personified deities, it is the impersonal vital ground of all existence\n- **Mantric Significance**: The silence (mauna) after OM (after a-u-m) corresponds to turīya; similarly, the pause between breaths (when neither inhalation nor exhalation occurs) is the sonic-prāṇic turīya; ajapa-japa (so'ham) practiced in kevala-kumbhaka accesses prāṇa-turīya; the transcendent nāda (unstruck sound, anāhata-nāda) is heard in prāṇa-turīya state\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Realization of prāṇa-turīya reveals that even vital energy is not the ultimate Self; the witness of prāṇa (prāṇa-sākṣin) abides in turīya; this understanding is part of viveka (discrimination) in Vedānta: \"I am not prāṇa, not even turīya-prāṇa, but the consciousness that witnesses all states of prāṇa\"; liberation (mokṣa) includes transcending identification with all prāṇic states including turīya\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Depicted as the space between breaths, the gap at the kumbhaka (retention) point; symbolized by the bindu (dot) above OM representing turīya; in cakra diagrams, corresponds to the brahmarandhra (fontanelle opening) where prāṇa transcends the body\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad (establishes turīya framework applied here to prāṇa); Yoga Vasishtha (applies avasthā analysis to prāṇa); Vijñāna Bhairava (verses on breath-gap awareness); Kena Upaniṣad (I.2: \"prāṇasya prāṇam\"); Śiva Sūtras; Spanda Kārikā; Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā (kevala-kumbhaka as turīya state)",

Root √आप् (āp) \"to obtain, attain\" → past participle prāpta (प्राप्त, obtained) → feminine noun prāpti (प्राप्ति, obtaining/attainment) → dative prāptaye (प्राप्तये, for obtaining). Dative case (caturthī vibhakti) shows purpose when used with abstract nouns: X-prāptaye = \"for obtaining X, in order to attain X\". Pattern: mokṣa-prāptaye (for liberation), sukha-prāptaye (for happiness), śānti-prāptaye (for peace). Declension: prāpti (stem) → prāptaye (dat. sg.), prāpteḥ (gen. sg.), prāptyā (instr. sg.). Mnemonic: \"prāptaye\" sounds like \"proper-tay\" (proper way) → the proper/purposeful way = \"for the purpose of attaining\".",

Root √प्री (prī) appears in: prīti (प्रीति, love, affection, pleasure), prīyate (प्रीयते, is pleased, loves), prīṇāti (प्रीणाति, pleases, gladdens). The -ya suffix forms adjectives: √prī + ya → priya (dear, beloved); √bhū + ya → bhavya (future, auspicious); √div + ya → divya (divine). Common compounds: priya-vādin (speaking pleasantly), priya-darśana (pleasant to see), priya-sakha (dear friend), priya-tama (dearest, superlative). As noun: priyā (प्रिया, feminine) = beloved woman, wife. Famous Upaniṣadic teaching: \"ātmā vā are draṣṭavyaḥ śrotavyaḥ...\" = \"the Self indeed should be seen, heard...for when the Self is known, all becomes dear (sarvam idaṁ priyaṁ bhavati)\".

Superlative suffix -tama = \"most, -est\" (like English \"-est\" in \"dearest\"). Degree formation: positive → comparative → superlative: priya (dear) → priya-tara (प्रियतर, dearer) → priya-tama (प्रियतम, dearest). Pattern works for all adjectives: sundara (beautiful) → sundara-tara (more beautiful) → sundara-tama (most beautiful). Feminine forms: priyatama (masc./neut.) → priyatamā (fem.), sundara-tama → sundara-tamā. Vocative use: \"he priyatame!\" (O dearest one, addressing feminine).

(addressing a woman affectionately)\n- Contextual: extremely common form of address in Sanskrit dialogues; appears throughout Yoga Vasishtha and other spiritual texts when addressing someone with affection or endearment; used by Vasiṣṭha when addressing Rāma, by gurus addressing disciples, by spouses addressing each other, by divine figures addressing devotees; can be used as simple affectionate address or to convey intimacy in spiritual instruction; the vocative creates immediacy and personal connection in teaching dialogues\n- Symbolic: represents the intimate, loving relationship between teacher and student, between seeker and guide; symbolizes that spiritual instruction is not impersonal transmission but loving communication; reflects the bhakti element present even in jñāna teachings; the use of \"beloved\" acknowledges the deep bond necessary for transformative spiritual teaching\n\n**Learning Tip**:\n- \"Priye\" = vocative singular feminine of priya/priyā (beloved). Vocative case (saṁbodhana, समान्बोधन) is for direct address: \"O ___!\". Declension: priyā (nom. sg.) → priye (voc. sg.). Pattern for ā-stem feminines: rāmā → he rāme! (O Rama!), devī → he devi! (O goddess!), priyā → he priye! (O beloved!). Often preceded by interjection हे (he, \"O\") though he is optional. Compare masculine vocative: priya (masc. nom.) → he priya! (O dear one, masc.). Common vocatives in spiritual texts: bhagavan (O Lord), devi (O goddess), prabho (O master), priye (O beloved). Mnemonic: \"priye\" sounds like \"pray-yay\" → \"O [one I] pray [to], yay!\" = affectionate address. Remember: vocative = calling/addressing someone directly.",

This b/v interchange occurs in some manuscripts and regional pronunciations. Standard: अभाव (abhāva). Variant: अभाब (abhāba). Both mean \"non-existence, absence\". The compound structure is identical to प्रेत्यभावसिद्धः (pretya + abhāva/abhāba + siddha). When encountering such variants, recognize them as spelling variations of the same concept. Remember: pretya (after death) + a-bhāva (non-existence) + siddha (accomplished) = one who achieves non-rebirth = liberated.",

Sandhi: asmāt + lokāt → asmāl-lokāt (t before l → l). Ablative case (pañcamī vibhakti) shows separation: \"from X\". Pattern: asmāt lokāt = \"from this world\". Amṛta (अमृत) = a (not) + mṛta (dead) = immortal, deathless (compare: ambrosia = immortality nectar). Root √मृ (mṛ) \"to die\": mṛta (dead), amṛta (not-dead = immortal), maraṇa (death), mṛtyu (death). Famous Upaniṣadic phrase: \"tameva viditvā ati mṛtyum eti\" (knowing That alone, one goes beyond death). Mnemonic: \"pretya\" (departed) + \"asmāl-lokāt\" (from this world) + \"amṛtā\" (immortal) = immortal by leaving this world.",

Sandhi: pra + ukta → prokta (a + u → o). Root √वच् (vac) \"to speak\": present vāk (speech), vacati (speaks), past participle ukta (spoken), with pra prefix → prokta (proclaimed). Pattern: pra + X → pro-X when X starts with u: pra + ukta → prokta, pra + ucchraya → procchraya. Compare: ukta (spoken), anukta (not spoken), vyukta (separately stated). Common phrase: \"yathā proktam\" (यथा प्रोक्तम्) = \"as has been said/taught\". Neuter form used for abstract \"what has been said\": proktam etat = \"this [teaching] has been proclaimed\".

Root √प्लु appears in: plavate (floats, swims), plāvana (flooding, bathing), plava (float, boat, raft), plavana (swimming, bathing). Past participle pattern: √plu + ta → plūta (floated). Examples of usage: ānanda-plūta (flooded with bliss), jñāna-plūta (overflowing with knowledge), prema-plūta (inundated with love). Also: snāna-plūta (bathed), jala-plūta (flooded with water). The long ū in plūta comes from the root. Mnemonic: \"plūta\" sounds like \"floating\" in English → floated, overflowed. Visual: consciousness \"floating\" like a leaf on water = effortless abiding.",

The suffix -kāra (कार from √kृ \"to make\") is used for naming letters/sounds: a-kāra (अकार, the sound 'a'), ka-kāra (ककार, the sound 'ka'), ma-kāra (मकार, the sound 'ma'). Pattern: X-kāra = \"the sound/letter X\". The pa-varga (labial series): प (pa, unaspirated unvoiced), फ (pha, aspirated unvoiced), ब (ba, unaspirated voiced), भ (bha, aspirated voiced), म (ma, nasal). Pha (फ्) is aspirated = \"pʰ\" with strong breath. Mnemonic: \"kāra\" (कार) = \"making\" → X-kāra = \"making the sound X\" = \"the letter X\". The ङ् (ṅ) in phaṅkāra may be variant spelling or indicate nasalization in certain traditions.",

Phala (फल) from √फल् (phal, to bear fruit, to result) = fruit, result, outcome, consequence. Āśraya (आश्रय) from आ ā + √श्रि śri (to lean on, resort to) = shelter, support, refuge, dependence. Pattern: X-āśraya = \"dependence on X, taking refuge in X, supported by X\". Examples: guru-āśraya (dependence on guru), śāstra-āśraya (reliance on scripture), ātma-āśraya (self-reliance). Opposite: niḥ-phalāśraya (without dependence on results), a-phalākāṅkṣin (not desiring fruits). Bhagavad Gītā teaching: \"karmaṇy eva adhikāras te mā phaleṣu kadācana\" (your right is to action alone, never to its fruits).

Standard: √वृ (vṛ, to choose) + -eṇya (worthy of) → vareṇya (worthy of choice, excellent). This suffix -eṇya indicates \"deserving of, worthy of\": √pūj (to worship) → pūjeṇya/pūjya (worthy of worship), √arc (to honor) → arceṇya/arcya (worthy of honor). Famous occurrence: Gāyatrī mantra \"tat savitur vareṇyaṃ bhargo devasya dhīmahi\" (that most excellent radiance of the divine Savitṛ we meditate upon). Root √वृ (vṛ) appears in: vara (choice, best, boon), varaṇa (choosing), viveka (discrimination = choosing between real/unreal). Mnemonic: vareṇya from √vṛ (choose) + -eṇya (worthy) = worthy of choosing = excellent.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Vareṇya appears in one of Hinduism's most sacred mantras (Gāyatrī) describing the Divine as \"most excellent, worthy of being chosen\"; philosophically represents the supreme goal (parama-puruṣārtha) that is worthy of all human striving; in Vedāntic discrimination (viveka), the Self is vareṇya while all else is a-vareṇya (not ultimately desirable); the term emphasizes free will and choice (vṛ) in spiritual life—the aspirant must choose (vṛ) the path and goal\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Ṛg Veda III.62.10 (Gāyatrī mantra: \"tat savitur vareṇyaṃ\"); Upaniṣads (describing Brahman as most desirable); Kaṭha Upaniṣad (choice between preyas [pleasant] and śreyas [good], where śreyas is vareṇya)",

Standard: varṇa (वर्ण). Multiple meanings: (1) **letter/sound** (the 50 varṇas of Sanskrit alphabet), (2) **color** (rūpa-varṇa = color and form), (3) **class/caste** (catur-varṇa = four classes). All meanings relate to \"appearance, manifestation, category\". The 50 varṇas: 16 vowels (a, ā, i, ī, u, ū, ṛ, ṝ, ḷ, ḹ, e, ai, o, au, aṁ, aḥ) + 34 consonants (ka-varga through ha).

Standard: vaśa (वश, control/power) + -itva (इत्व, abstract noun suffix = \"-ness, -hood, state of\") → vaśitva (state of control). The -itva/-tva suffixes form abstract nouns: deva → devatva (divinity), puruṣa → puruṣatva (manhood), vaśa → vaśitva (controlledness/mastery). Root √वश् (vaś) \"to wish, desire, be able\": vaśa (control, will), vaśī (controller, master), vaśya (controllable). Two meanings: (1) state of being controlled (self-mastery), (2) power to control others (siddhi). As siddhi, vaśitva is one of aṣṭa-siddhi (eight superpowers): aṇimā, mahimā, laghimā, prāpti, prākāmya, īśitva, **vaśitva**, kāmavasāyitva. Mnemonic: \"vaśa\" sounds like \"vash\" (control) → vaśitva = controlledness/control-power.",

Standard: vaṣaṭ (वषट्). Vedic ritual exclamations: **svāhā** (स्वाहा, most common, offerings to gods), **vaṣaṭ** (वषट्, offerings to gods by hotṛ), **vauṣaṭ** (वौषट्, offerings to gods by adhvaryu), **svadhā** (स्वधा, offerings to ancestors), **vaṣaṭkāra** (utterance of vaṣaṭ). Pattern: offering + vaṣaṭ = oblation consecrated. Etymology possibly from √vah (to carry/convey) → vaṣaṭ = \"may it be conveyed [to the deity]\". Used in sequence: mantra naming deity + havis offered into fire + priest utters \"vaṣaṭ!\" = complete offering. Mnemonic: \"vaṣaṭ\" sounds like \"wash-at\" → washing/conveying offering to gods = ritual completion sound.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Vaṣaṭ is the sonic bridge between mortal and immortal realms; it is the sound-energy (śabda-śakti) that carries offerings from the material fire (laukika-agni) to the cosmic fire (daivī-agni) and thence to the deities (devatās); the utterance activates the ritual's spiritual dimension, transforming mere burning into sacred transmission; represents the power of vāc (speech/word) to effect ontological transformation\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: In internalized ritual (anta-yāga, prāṇa-agnihotra), vaṣaṭ represents the moment of offering prāṇa or mental impressions into the inner fire of awareness; the exclamation signifies completion, release, letting-go; marks the transition from doing to offering, from ego-ownership to divine surrender\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Primarily associated with Agni (fire god) as the divine messenger and carrier of offerings; Agni, invoked with vaṣaṭ, conveys the oblation to the specific deity being worshiped; vaṣaṭ empowers Agni in his role as havyavāhana (carrier of offerings); the sound is the energetic command that activates Agni's conveying function\n- **Mantric Significance**: Vaṣaṭ is a vyāhṛti (ritual utterance) rather than bīja (seed syllable); it functions as a saṃskāra-mantra (consecrating formula); the -ṣaṭ termination with cerebral ष (ṣa) has particular sonic potency; in Tantric internalization, vaṣaṭ can be used in subtle offering (mānasa-pūjā) or offering of the ego into the fire of consciousness\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Philosophically, vaṣaṭ represents karma-phala-tyāga (renunciation of fruits of action); the moment of uttering vaṣaṭ is the moment of release, non-attachment, offering; it embodies the Gītā teaching of performing action as offering (yajña) without clinging to results; the exclamation marks the transition from kartṛtva (doership) to arpaṇa (offering); symbolizes the completion of action through surrender\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Depicted in ritual diagrams at the moment when oblation meets flame; symbolized by upward-rising flames and smoke carrying offerings; represents the vertical axis from earth (offering) through fire (transformation) to heaven (deity reception)\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Ṛg Veda Saṃhitā (numerous occurrences in ritual hymns); Yajur Veda (especially Śukla and Kṛṣṇa Yajur Veda ritual formulas); Brāhmaṇa texts (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, Aitareya Brāhmaṇa explaining vaṣaṭ-kāra); Śrauta Sūtras (detailed ritual instructions for vaṣaṭ utterance); Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā texts (on the efficacy of ritual utterances)",

Instrumental plural -bhiḥ = \"with, by means of, through\". Pattern: X-bhiḥ = \"with/by X\". Eight principles in Sāṃkhya: prakṛti's eight-fold evolution = pañca-mahābhūta (earth, water, fire, air, ether) + manas (mind) + buddhi (intellect) + ahaṃkāra (ego) = 8. Aṣṭa-mūrti of Śiva = eight forms: earth, water, fire, air, ether, sun, moon, self. Mnemonic: \"aṣṭa\" (eight) + \"īśa\" (lord) → lord of eightfold manifestation.",

Standard: √वह् (vah, to carry/flow) + -ति (ti, 3rd sg. present) → vahati (carries, flows). Conjugation of √vah: vahati (3rd sg.), vahāmi (1st sg.), vahasi (2nd sg.). Root √वह् (vah) appears in: vāhana (vehicle, that which carries), vahana (carrying), āvaha (bringing toward), pravāha (current, flow), udvaha (carrying up). Common usage: nadī vahati (the river flows), vāyuḥ vahati (the wind blows), rathaḥ vahati (the chariot carries), kālaḥ vahati (time carries [all things]). Mnemonic: \"vah-\" sounds like \"veh-icle\" → vehicle carries = vahati = carries/flows.",

Bahis (बहिस्/बहिर्) = outside, external (opposite: antar अन्तर् = inside). Aṅga (अङ्ग) = limb, part, member, division. Aṣṭāṅga-yoga (eight limbs) divided into: **Bahiraṅga** (external, first 5): yama, niyama, āsana, prāṇāyāma, pratyāhāra; **Antaraṅga** (internal, last 3): dhāraṇā, dhyāna, samādhi. Also called: bahiraṅga-sādhana (external practices) vs. antaraṅga-sādhana (internal practices). Pattern: bahir-X (external X) vs. antar-X (internal X): bahir-mukha (outward-facing) vs. antar-mukha (inward-facing). Mnemonic: \"bahir\" sounds like \"barrier\" → outer barrier/external = bahiraṅga.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Bahiraṅga represents the outer circumference of spiritual practice that interfaces with the material world; these practices purify the gross aspects of being—body (āsana), energy (prāṇāyāma), ethics (yama-niyama), sensory engagement (pratyāhāra); they prepare the vessel (adhikāra) for deeper inner work (antaraṅga); without bahiraṅga foundation, antaraṅga practices lack stability; represents the manifestation-side of sādhana\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: The five bahiraṅga practices systematically prepare body-mind: yama-niyama purify volition and character; āsana stabilizes body and prāṇic currents; prāṇāyāma refines prāṇa and removes nāḍī blockages; pratyāhāra withdraws energy from sensory dispersion; together they create the sthiratā (stability) and śuddhi (purity) required for dhāraṇā (concentration); bahiraṅga works primarily on annamaya-kośa, prāṇamaya-kośa, and indriyas\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Gaṇeśa (remover of obstacles) is associated with bahiraṅga as these practices remove outer impediments; the deities of the lower cakras (Gaṇeśa at mūlādhāra, Brahmā at svādhiṣṭhāna, etc.) govern bahiraṅga domain\n- **Mantric Significance**: Bahiraṅga practices use gross mantras and external forms; utterance is vocal (vācika) or mental but with form (saguṇa); as practice deepens toward antaraṅga, mantra becomes subtler, moving from gross sound to internal vibration to soundless resonance\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Bahiraṅga establishes dharmic foundation (yama-niyama) and prepares consciousness for inward turn; while essential, these practices are means (sādhana) not goal (sādhya); over-emphasis on bahiraṅga alone keeps practitioner at superficial level; balanced approach: establish bahiraṅga then progressively move to antaraṅga; in jīvanmukti, bahiraṅga continues naturally but without identification\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Depicted as the outer walls, courtyards, and gateways of a temple, leading progressively inward to the garbha-gṛha (inner sanctum = antaraṅga); in yogic diagrams, the outer practices surrounding the central core of consciousness\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Yoga Sūtra of Patañjali (III.7-8 explicitly distinguishes bahiraṅga from antaraṅga: \"trayam antaraṅgaṃ pūrvebhyaḥ\" = the three [dhāraṇā, dhyāna, samādhi] are internal compared to the previous [five]); commentaries by Vyāsa, Vācaspati Miśra; Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā; Yoga Yājñavalkya",

Bahis (बहिस्/बहिः) = outside, outward (opposite: antar = inside). Indriya (इन्द्रिय) = sense organ, faculty. Two types of indriya: (1) **jñānendriya** (ज्ञानेन्द्रिय) = organs of knowledge/perception (5): ear, skin, eye, tongue, nose; (2) **karmendriya** (कर्मेन्द्रिय) = organs of action (5): voice, hands, feet, anus, genitals. Total: 10 indriyas. Bahirindriyāṇi = senses oriented outward toward objects (viṣaya). Contrast: antaḥkaraṇa (अन्तःकरण) = internal instrument = manas-buddhi-ahaṃkāra-citta. Pratyāhāra = withdrawing bahirindriyāṇi from viṣayas. Mnemonic: \"bahir\" (outer) + \"indriya\" (sense) → senses flowing outward.",

Declension irregular: vāk (nom. sg.), vācam (acc. sg.), vācā (inst. sg.), vāci (loc. sg.). Four levels of vāk: (1) **parā** (परा) = supreme, transcendent; (2) **paśyantī** (पश्यन्ती) = seeing, visionary; (3) **madhyamā** (मध्यमा) = intermediate, mental; (4) **vaikharī** (वैखरी) = gross, articulated. Goddess: Vāc/Sarasvatī = goddess of speech, learning, arts. Vāk-śakti = power of speech. Mnemonic: \"vāk\" sounds like \"v-awk\" (voice-talk) → speech/voice = vāk.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Vāk is the primordial cosmic vibration (nāda, spanda, śabda-brahman) through which the unmanifest Brahman becomes manifest creation; the creative logos or divine word; in the Ṛg Veda, Vāk declares \"I pervade heaven and earth\" and \"I give birth to the father [Brahman] on the head of this [creation]\"—showing Vāk as the creative śakti; in Kashmir Śaivism, parā-vāk is the highest vibration of consciousness (cit-spanda) which descends through paśyantī, madhyamā, to vaikharī (our gross speech); all manifestation is vāk-prapañca (expansion of the Word)\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: Vāk-sādhana (practice with speech/mantra) purifies consciousness; the four levels of vāk correspond to progressively subtler dimensions: vaikharī (throat cakra, gross speech), madhyamā (heart cakra, mental speech), paśyantī (navel cakra, intuitive seeing), parā (beyond cakras, transcendent vibration); mantra-japa moves from vaikharī (vocal) through madhyamā (mental) to ajapa (spontaneous, subtle); realization of parā-vāk is realization of śabda-brahman\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Vāk is personified as the goddess Vāc/Sarasvatī, consort of Brahmā (creator); she is white-clad, holding vīṇā (cosmic harmony), book (knowledge), japa-mālā (mantra), kamaṇḍalu (waters of wisdom); as Sarasvatī, she governs learning, music, arts, eloquence; in Tantra, she is Mātṛkā-śakti (power of the letters/phonemes); the 50 varṇas (letters) are her 50 forms; she is invoked for speech-perfection (vāk-siddhi)\n- **Mantric Significance**: All mantras are manifestations of Vāk-śakti; the bīja mantras are condensed forms of cosmic vāk; OM is the quintessence of vāk; the practice of mantra-japa is worship of Vāk/Sarasvatī; vāk-siddhi (perfection of speech) is attained through mantra; the Gāyatrī mantra addresses Savitr but is itself vāk; perfect speech (ṛta-vāk, satya-vāk) arises from realization of parā-vāk; silence (mauna) is the womb of vāk\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Satya-vācana (truthful speech) is fundamental dharma; right speech (samyag-vāk) is part of the eightfold path; vāk is a primary means of knowledge (śabda-pramāṇa = verbal testimony); Vedas are called apauruṣeya-vāk (non-human speech, divine revelation); the power of vāk creates bondage (through false speech, harsh speech) or liberation (through mantra, truth, sacred study); in jīvanmukti, one's speech becomes spontaneous truth (ṛta-vāk)\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Depicted as Goddess Sarasvatī with vīṇā (cosmic sound), swan (discrimination), lotus (purity), book (Vedas); in yantras, represented by the Mātṛkā (alphabet letters) arranged in cakras; the 50 petals of the cakras bearing the 50 varṇas represent Vāk's manifestation; in iconography, the tongue (jihvā) is the seat of Vāk-devī\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Ṛg Veda X.125 (Vāk-sūkta—hymn of Speech personified); Ṛg Veda X.71 (on the origin of speech); Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (I.5.3, vāk as vital force); Taittirīya Upaniṣad (on vāk and prāṇa); Vāc Ambhṛṇī Sūkta; Devī Māhātmya (Sarasvatī as Vāk); Tantric texts on four levels of vāk (Tantrāloka, Parā-triṃśikā-vivaraṇa); Vākyapadīya of Bhartṛhari (philosophy of language and vāk); Yoga Vāsiṣṭha; Śiva Sūtras",

Examples: pāṇi-graha (taking hand = marriage), su-pāṇi (beautiful hands), pāṇi-tala (palm). Pattern of \"speaking X\": vāk-cakṣus (speaking eye = expressive eyes), vāk-mudrā (speech gesture). In context: hasta-mudrās (hand gestures) in dance and ritual are vākpāṇi—hands that speak. The 24 single-hand mudrās and 13 double-hand mudrās in Bharata-nāṭya each convey specific meanings = vākpāṇi. Mnemonic: vāk (speech) + pāṇi (hand) → hand that speaks = expressive gesture.",

Pattern: X-m iti = \"thus X, this is X, X is thus\". Examples: etat iti (thus this), sat iti (thus [called] existence), brahma iti (thus [called] Brahman). Accusative + iti often means \"this is what is meant by X\" or \"X is thus\".

Vijñāna (विज्ञान) = discernment, higher knowledge, science. Maya suffix (मय) = \"made of, consisting of\" (like annamaya = made of food, prāṇamaya = made of life force). This is the fourth kośa: annamaya (food) → prāṇamaya (vital energy) → manomaya (mind) → vijñānamaya (wisdom) → ānandamaya (bliss). Vijñānamaya is the sheath of buddhi (intellect) and viveka (discrimination). Mnemonic: vijñāna (special knowledge) + maya (made of) → wisdom sheath. Taittirīya Upaniṣad describes all five kośas systematically, showing vijñānamaya as subtler than mano but grosser than ānanda.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Vijñānamaya-kośa is the fourth of five nested sheaths (kośa) encasing the Ātman; it corresponds to the buddhitattva (intellect principle) in Sāṃkhya philosophy and is the seat of discriminative wisdom; this sheath enables the individual (jīva) to distinguish between Self and not-Self; it is the locus of spiritual decision-making and philosophical insight; vijñānamaya bridges the empirical mind (manas) and pure consciousness (cit); in cosmic manifestation, it represents the causal/intellectual layer of existence\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: Associated with ājñā-cakra (third eye center), the seat of intuitive wisdom and command; cultivation of vijñānamaya occurs through viveka-khyāti (discriminative discernment) and śravaṇa-manana-nididhyāsana (hearing-reflection-meditation) practice; advanced yogis refine vijñānamaya to achieve prajñā (wisdom), then transcend it entirely; meditation pierces through vijñānamaya when the meditator realizes even wisdom-formations are objects, not the subject; the vijñānamaya level is where one practices ātma-anātma-viveka (Self/not-Self discrimination)\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Vijñānamaya is governed by buddhi-śakti (power of intellect) and presided over by deities of wisdom such as Sarasvatī (goddess of learning) and Gaṇeśa (remover of obstacles to knowledge); Dākṣiṇāmūrti (south-facing Śiva as supreme teacher) embodies perfected vijñānamaya\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Central to the Vedantic path of jñāna-yoga (yoga of knowledge); vijñānamaya-kośa is where viveka (discrimination between eternal and non-eternal) operates; this sheath must be cultivated to mature spiritual understanding, but ultimately transcended—even vijñāna is a kośa (covering) hiding pure Ātman; liberation requires going beyond vijñānamaya to recognize oneself as the witnessing consciousness (sākṣin) observing even wisdom-thoughts\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Depicted as a luminous sphere or sheath of radiant light surrounding the inner sheaths; often symbolized by the rising sun or clear mirror reflecting truth; in iconography, represented by the third eye (ājñā) or crown region; the clarity and brilliance of vijñānamaya contrasts with the turbulence of manomaya\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Taittirīya Upaniṣad (II.3-5) systematically describes the pañca-kośa model including vijñānamaya-kośa; extensively discussed in Vedānta-sāra, Pañcadaśī, and Vivekacūḍāmaṇi; foundational to Advaita Vedanta's method of negation (neti-neti) applied to the kośas",

One of the most fundamental Sanskrit roots! Derivatives: veda (knowledge/Veda), vidyā (knowledge/learning), vidvān (wise one), vijñāna (discernment/science), vedānta (Vedanta/end of knowledge), vetti (knows, present tense), veda (knows, perfect as present), viduḥ (they know), jñā + vid compounds. Two conjugation classes: class II (vetti, vidmaḥ) and class VI. Perfect tense used as present: veda = \"I know\" (established knowledge). Mnemonic: vid → veda → vidyā → all knowledge terms. English cognates: \"wit,\" \"wisdom,\" \"video\" (Latin \"to see\" = to know). This root appears in countless philosophical terms—master it!\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: √Vid represents the fundamental capacity of consciousness (cit) to know itself; in Vedantic metaphysics, Brahman is described as sat-cit-ānanda (existence-consciousness-bliss), and the cit aspect is the vid function—pure knowing without object-subject division; vid is not a mental activity but the inherent self-luminosity (svaprakāśatva) of consciousness; the universe arises in Brahman's vid (self-knowing), and individual knowing (jīva-jñāna) is a reflection of this cosmic vid\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: The realization sought through all yogic practices is ultimately vid—direct knowing (aparokṣa-jñāna or sākṣātkāra) of one's true nature; meditation (dhyāna) refines the knowing faculty from objective knowledge (viṣaya-jñāna) to pure self-awareness (svarūpa-vid); the transition from śravaṇa (hearing) to manana (reflection) to nididhyāsana (meditation) is the maturation of vid from conceptual to experiential; samādhi is the perfection of vid where knower, knowing, and known merge\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Vid is associated with Sarasvatī (goddess of knowledge, speech, and learning), who embodies the vidyā-śakti (power of knowledge); Dākṣiṇāmūrti (south-facing Śiva) as the supreme guru represents perfected vid teaching in silence; the Vedas personify vid as divine revelation (śruti) received by ṛṣis\n- **Mantric Significance**: The syllable OM represents the totality of vid—past, present, and future knowledge compressed into sound; Gāyatrī mantra is a prayer for illumination of the buddhi (intellect), which is the instrument of vid; many mantras end with \"vidmahe\" (may we know)—invoking the vid faculty for realization\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Vid is the essential means (sādhana) and goal (sādhya) of jñāna-yoga; the central Upaniṣadic inquiry \"ātmānaṁ viddhi\" (know the Self) makes vid the primary spiritual imperative; liberation (mokṣa) is defined as brahma-vid (knowing Brahman); the distinction between avidyā (ignorance, non-knowing) and vidyā (knowledge, true knowing) is the fundamental divide between bondage and freedom; vid when directed toward the Self becomes Self-realization\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Represented by light, illumination, the sun (symbolic of knowledge dispelling darkness of ignorance); the third eye (ājñā-cakra) symbolizes the intuitive vid beyond sensory knowing; the flame or lamp (dīpa) symbolizes the self-luminous nature of vid\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: All four Vedas (Ṛg, Yajur, Sāma, Atharva) derive their name from √vid; Upaniṣads extensively use vid in key statements like \"brahma veda brahmaiva bhavati\" (the knower of Brahman becomes Brahman); Bhagavad Gītā uses vid throughout (e.g., \"vedānta-kṛd veda-vid eva cāham\" - I am the author of Vedānta and knower of the Vedas, XV.15); Yoga Vasishtha's entire teaching aims at ātma-vid (Self-knowledge)",

Realize now!\"\n\n**Learning Tip**:\n- \"Biddhi\" is variant of \"viddhi\" (विद्धि) with ब for व. Root: √विद् (vid) = to know. Imperative 2nd person singular: vid + dhi = viddhi (you, know!). Used for direct instruction/command. Related imperatives: jānīhi (know!, from √jñā), paśya (see!), śṛṇu (hear!). Pattern: viddhi often introduces key teachings: \"evaṁ viddhi\" (know thus), \"māṁ viddhi\" (know me), \"tad viddhi\" (know that), \"ātmānaṁ viddhi\" (know the Self). Bhagavad Gītā uses viddhi frequently: \"śraddhāvān labhate jñānaṁ tat-paraḥ saṁyatendriyaḥ / jñānaṁ labdhvā parāṁ śāntim acireṇādhigacchati\" followed by imperatives. Mnemonic: viddhi = \"vid (know) + dhi (you!) → Know!\" The spiritual command to realize directly.",

Root: √विद् (vid) = to know/to exist. Passive present: vid + ya (passive) + te (3rd singular) = vidyate (it is known/found/exists). Common meaning: \"there is, it exists, it is found.\" Pattern: \"yatra vidyate\" (where there is), \"na vidyate\" (there is not, it doesn't exist), \"tatra vidyate\" (there it is found). Active vetti (he knows) → passive vidyate (it is known). Related: विद्यमान (vidyamāna, present participle, \"existing, being present\"). Mnemonic: vid (know) + passive → \"is known\" = \"exists, is found.\" Extremely common in philosophical texts for asserting existence or presence.",

Two types: parā-vidyā (supreme knowledge of Brahman) and aparā-vidyā (lower knowledge). Related: vijñāna (discernment), vidvān (learned one), veda (knowledge/scripture). Compounds: brahma-vidyā (knowledge of Brahman), ātma-vidyā (knowledge of Self). Goddess Sarasvatī embodies vidyā. Mnemonic: vid (know) + yā (feminine abstract) → knowledge/learning. Central to all Indian philosophical systems as means to liberation.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Vidyā is the cosmic principle of illumination and revelation; in Vedantic cosmology, Brahman manifests through vidyā-śakti (power of knowledge) and avidyā-śakti (power of ignorance); vidyā is the force that leads consciousness back to its source, while avidyā veils and projects multiplicity; supreme vidyā (parā-vidyā) is direct knowledge of the non-dual Self, while lower vidyā (aparā-vidyā) includes all empirical and scriptural learning; vidyā operates within the causal body (kāraṇa-śarīra) to eventually destroy avidyā\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: Vidyā is cultivated through the threefold practice of śravaṇa (hearing the teachings), manana (reflection on their meaning), and nididhyāsana (deep meditation); associated with ājñā-cakra (third eye) and sahasrāra-cakra (crown), seats of intuitive wisdom; the awakening of vidyā corresponds to the rise of kuṇḍalinī through higher cakras; jñāna-yoga is the path of vidyā, using discrimination (viveka) and dispassion (vairāgya) to realize truth; vidyā-śakti purifies the buddhi (intellect) until it reflects pure consciousness\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Vidyā is personified as the goddess Sarasvatī, consort of Brahmā, who presides over learning, speech, music, and the arts; also identified with Mahāvidyā traditions in Tantra, where ten wisdom goddesses (daśa-mahāvidyā) embody different aspects of divine knowledge; Dākṣiṇāmūrti (south-facing Śiva) represents the supreme guru transmitting vidyā in silence; vidyā-śakti is the illuminating power of Śakti complementing Śiva's pure consciousness\n- **Mantric Significance**: \"Om aiṁ sarasvatyai namaḥ\" invokes vidyā through Sarasvatī; the syllable AIM (aiṁ) is the bīja-mantra of Sarasvatī and vidyā; Gāyatrī mantra requests illumination of the intellect (dhiyo yo naḥ pracodayāt) and is considered the essence of all vidyā; many Upaniṣadic mantras end with \"vidmahe\" (may we know), invoking vidyā\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Vidyā is the central means (upāya) to mokṣa (liberation) in jñāna-mārga (path of knowledge); the fundamental distinction in Vedanta is between vidyā (knowledge) and avidyā (ignorance)—liberation is the replacement of avidyā with vidyā; \"vidyayā amṛtam aśnute\" (through knowledge one attains immortality) is the Upaniṣadic promise; brahma-vidyā is called \"sarva-vidyā-pratiṣṭhā\" (foundation of all knowledge); the highest vidyā is ātma-jñāna (Self-knowledge)\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Depicted as light (dīpa, jyoti) dispelling darkness (ignorance); Sarasvatī holds a book (pustaka) or scriptures (veda) representing vidyā; the lotus symbolizes the unfolding of vidyā; white color represents purity and clarity of vidyā; swan (haṁsa) represents discrimination (viveka), ability to separate milk from water, real from unreal\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad (I.1.3-5) distinguishes parā-vidyā and aparā-vidyā; Īśa Upaniṣad (verses 9-11) discusses vidyā and avidyā; Bhagavad Gītā uses vidyā extensively in the context of discrimination and Self-knowledge; all Upaniṣads are considered vidyā-śāstra (texts of knowledge); Yoga Vasishtha teaches ātma-vidyā as supreme knowledge; Vivekacūḍāmaṇi of Śaṅkara is a treatise on ātma-vidyā",

  "बिन्दु": "# बिन्दु\n**Transliteration**: bin-du\n**POS**: noun (masculine) — variant spelling\n\n**Root Analysis**:\n- This is a variant spelling of बिन्दु (bindu), which is the standard form (not a व/ब variant)\n- Etymology uncertain; possibly from √बिन्द् (bind) \"to drop, to fall in drops\" + उ (u) noun suffix = बिन्दु (bindu) \"drop, point, dot\"\n- Alternative derivation: onomatopoetic origin representing the sound of a drop falling\n- Note: बिन्दु is the standard spelling; विन्दु is rare\n\n**Meanings**:\n- Literal: drop, dot, point, spot, mark, zero, circle, particle, bead\n- Contextual: in yogic and tantric traditions, bindu has profound metaphysical significance as the primordial point of manifestation; represents the concentrated seed-form of all creation before expansion; in haṭha-yoga, bindu refers to the vital fluid or essence retained through yogic practices; the anusvāra (ṁ) in Sanskrit phonetics is called bindu, appearing as a dot above letters; in Kashmir Śaivism, bindu is the first emanation from paramaśiva, the point where unity begins to manifest as multiplicity; geometrically, bindu is the central point in śrī-yantra and other yantras, representing the seat of the deity\n- Symbolic: represents the undifferentiated unity before creation (sṛṣṭi); symbolizes consciousness in its most concentrated form before manifestation; embodies the principle of potentiality—all forms exist potentially in the bindu; the zero-point from which all numbers/phenomena arise; bindu is śakti coiled at the point of emergence\n\n**Learning Tip**:\n- \"Bindu\" (बिन्दु) = drop, point, dot. Possibly from √बिन्द् (bind, to drop). Central concept in Tantra and Yoga! Multiple meanings: (1) physical drop (liquid), (2) geometric point/dot, (3) anusvāra (ṁ) symbol in writing, (4) metaphysical seed-point of creation, (5) vital essence in haṭha-yoga. Related: nāda-bindu (sound-point continuum in Tantra). In śrī-yantra, bindu is central point where śakti resides. Mnemonic: bindu = \"point/drop\" → concentrated essence before expansion. Crucial in meditation (ekāgratā on bindu), mantra (ṁ sound), and metaphysics (source-point of manifestation).\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Bindu represents the primordial point of cosmic manifestation in tantric cosmology; it is the first stage of creation where undifferentiated consciousness (śiva) and energy (śakti) unite; from bindu emerges nāda (cosmic vibration), then bīja (seed syllables), and finally the entire manifest universe; in Kashmir Śaivism's 36 tattvas, bindu appears as a stage in the descent (avaroha) from paramaśiva; bindu contains all potential forms in unmanifest seed-state (avyakta); it is the transition point between unity and multiplicity, being and becoming; the entire universe is said to expand from and contract back into bindu\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: In kuṇḍalinī yoga, bindu-cakra (also called soma-cakra or indu-cakra) is located at the back top of the head, where a tuft of hair (śikhā) is kept by traditional practitioners; bindu is associated with retention of vital essence (bindu-siddhi) in haṭha-yoga, preventing the downward flow of ojas; meditation on bindu develops one-pointed concentration (ekāgratā); the practice of trataka (gazing) often uses a bindu (dot) as focus point; in advanced stages, the yogi perceives inner lights (jyoti-darśana) as bindus of different colors; bindu-dhyāna (meditation on the point) leads to dissolution of mind and merger with source\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Bindu is the seat of the goddess in śrī-yantra, where all divine śaktis are concentrated; represents parā-śakti in her most subtle, undifferentiated form before manifesting as the trinity of creation-sustenance-dissolution; in some tantric traditions, bindu is personified as Bindu-nātha or Bindu-mālinī; the goddess Tripurā-sundarī resides at the bindu in the center of śrī-yantra; bindu is also associated with Śiva in his form as concentrated consciousness (cit-ghana)\n- **Mantric Significance**: The anusvāra (ṁ), written as a dot (bindu) above syllables, represents the nasal resonance and is considered the acoustic form of bindu; in the sacred syllable OM (ॐ), the bindu above represents the transcendent fourth state (turīya) beyond A-U-M; every bīja-mantra contains bindu (ṁ): Hrīṁ, Śrīṁ, Krīṁ, etc.; the sound ṁ is the sonic gateway to formless consciousness; bindu-nāda (the unity of point and sound) is central to nāda-yoga, the yoga of inner sound; chanting with awareness of bindu leads to laya (dissolution) in the source\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Bindu represents the non-dual state (advaita) before the appearance of subject-object duality; it is pure consciousness (cit) in undifferentiated form, prior to all vikalpas (mental constructions); realization of one's identity with bindu is recognition of one's essence as the source-point of all experience; bindu-bheda (piercing the bindu) is a term for breakthrough to transcendent awareness; liberation (mokṣa) is sometimes described as merger with the bindu, the return to primordial unity; bindu embodies the Vedantic teaching that all multiplicity emerges from and returns to the One\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Depicted as a dot (•) or small circle (◦) in the center of yantras, especially śrī-yantra; in Devanāgarī script, appears as the anusvāra mark (ं) above letters; represented in iconography as a drop of nectar (amṛta), a pearl, or a flame; geometrically, the bindu is dimensionless yet contains all dimensions; in art, shown as the starting point from which all patterns emanate; the tilaka (forehead mark) worn by devotees represents the bindu, marking the ājñā-cakra; zero (śūnya) is related to bindu conceptually—both represent fullness through apparent emptiness\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Described extensively in tantric texts like Tantra-rāja-tantra, Kulārṇava-tantra, and Śiva-sūtra; central to Kashmir Śaivism texts such as Vijñāna-bhairava, Pratyabhijñā-hṛdayam, and Spanda-kārikā; discussed in haṭha-yoga texts like Haṭha-yoga-pradīpikā and Gheraṇḍa-saṃhitā in context of bindu-siddhi; Nāda-bindu Upaniṣad devoted entirely to the metaphysics of nāda and bindu; Śrī-vidyā tradition texts elaborate on bindu as the center of śrī-yantra; Lalitā-sahasra-nāma includes epithets describing the goddess as residing in bindu",

This distinguishes singular bindu from dual bindus. In Tantra: para-bindu (transcendent point) vs. śiva-śakti-bindu-dvaya (dual polarity). In haṭha-yoga: śukla-bindu (white/semen) and rakta-bindu (red/ovum). Mnemonic: bindu (one point) + bindu-dvaya (two points) → unity and duality, One and Two. Represents emanation: 1 → 2 → many.",

Sandhi: binduḥ + tena → bindus tena (ḥ → s before t); tena + eva → tenaiva (a + e → ai). Tena (तेन) = instrumental \"by that, through that\" (from tat = that). Eva (एव) = emphatic particle \"indeed, alone, very, certainly\" (adds emphasis/exclusivity). Pattern: X-eva = \"X alone, X indeed\": sa eva (he alone), tad eva (that very thing). Common in assertions: \"tenaiva\" = \"by that very [thing], through that alone.\" Mnemonic: bindu (point) + tena (by that) + eva (alone/indeed) → \"by that bindu alone\" → emphasizes exclusive causation.

Root: वि (vi, apart) + √भज् (bhaj, to divide/share). Bhāga (भाग) = part, portion, share. Vi-bhāga = \"apart-division\" → separation, partition, distribution. Opposite: abheda (अभेद, non-division, unity), yoga (योग, union). Related: bhāga (part, share), bhajana (division, worship), vibhakti (case division in grammar), vibheda (distinction). Pattern: vi-X often indicates separation/division: vi-yoga (separation), vi-ccheda (cutting apart). Mnemonic: vi (apart) + bhāga (part) → separation into parts, division. In Vedanta: vibhāga-buddhi (divisive intellect) sees multiplicity instead of unity. The enlightened one sees no vibhāga (division) in the One.",

Opposite: sa-mṛtyu (mortal), sa-śoka (sorrowful). Upaniṣadic epithets for Ātman/Brahman. Mnemonic: vi (without) + mṛtyu (death) + vi (without) + śoka (sorrow) → deathless and sorrowless = liberated Self. Kaṭha Upaniṣad describes realized one as transcending death and sorrow.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Vimṛtyu-viśoka represents the essential characteristics of liberation (mokṣa) in Vedantic teaching; the Self (Ātman) is inherently vimṛtyu (deathless, immortal, eternal) because it never was born and never dies—only the body experiences birth and death; the Self is viśoka (sorrowless) because sorrow arises from identification with the body-mind and attachment to transient objects, neither of which touch pure consciousness; realization of \"aham brahmāsmi\" (I am Brahman) reveals one's vimṛtyu-viśoka nature; these two freedoms summarize the goal of spiritual practice\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Chāndogya Upaniṣad describes Brahman and the realized Self using these terms; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad teaches freedom from death and sorrow through Self-knowledge; Kaṭha Upaniṣad emphasizes transcendence of death (mṛtyu-mukta); Bhagavad Gītā describes the Self as eternal (nitya, śāśvata) and beyond sorrow; Yoga Vasishtha extensively teaches the sorrowless nature of enlightenment",

Etymology: vi (widely) + √rāj (to shine/rule). Meaning: \"shining everywhere\" = cosmic form, universal body. In Vedantic four-state model: (1) Virāṭ (cosmic) / Viśva (individual) = waking, (2) Hiraṇyagarbha (cosmic) / Taijasa (individual) = dreaming, (3) Īśvara (cosmic) / Prājña (individual) = deep sleep, (4) Brahman / Turīya = transcendent. Virāṭ is the totality of physical universe as divine body. Bhagavad Gītā XI: Kṛṣṇa's virāṭa-rūpa (cosmic form) shown to Arjuna. Mnemonic: vi (everywhere) + rāj (shine) → cosmic shining = universal form. Virāṭ-Puruṣa = Cosmic Person containing all beings.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Virāṭ is the cosmic manifestation of Brahman, the totality of the physical universe viewed as a single organism; in Vedantic cosmology, Virāṭ is the\n\n first gross manifestation, corresponding to sthūla-śarīra (gross body) at the cosmic level; the entire visible universe with all its galaxies, worlds, and beings is the body of Virāṭ; Virāṭ is associated with the waking state (jāgrat-avasthā) and with Viśva (individual waking consciousness); corresponds to the first quarter of OM in Māṇḍūkya teaching; Virāṭ is the macrocosmic counterpart to the human body\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: Meditation on Virāṭ involves visualizing the entire cosmos as the divine body; Virāṭ-upāsanā (worship/contemplation of the cosmic form) expands awareness from individual to universal; helps dissolve egoic identification by seeing oneself as part of cosmic whole; preparatory practice for higher non-dual realization; some yoga systems associate different parts of Virāṭ's body with different realms and deities\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Virāṭ is personified as Virāṭ-Puruṣa (Cosmic Person) in Ṛg Veda's Puruṣa-sūkta; identified with Nārāyaṇa, Viṣṇu, or Brahmā in different traditions; the virāṭa-rūpa of Kṛṣṇa in Bhagavad Gītā XI is the most famous depiction—Arjuna sees all worlds, beings, gods, and time itself within Kṛṣṇa's cosmic form; Virāṭ contains all deities as parts of one universal divinity\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Virāṭ represents Brahman's immanent aspect—divinity not as transcendent otherness but as the very fabric of manifest reality; realization of Virāṭ overcomes the illusion that the world is separate from or opposed to spirit; \"seeing God in everything\" is seeing Virāṭ; leads to cosmic consciousness where individual awareness expands to encompass the whole; intermediate stage between dualistic devotion and absolute non-dual realization\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Depicted as the Cosmic Person (Puruṣa) whose body constitutes the universe; in iconography of Bhagavad Gītā XI, shown with countless faces, eyes, arms, containing all beings, gods, worlds, and time; Puruṣa-sūkta describes cosmic sacrifice where Virāṭ's body parts become different parts of creation; represented as the macrocosm in diagrams showing correspondence between cosmos and human body\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Ṛg Veda Puruṣa-sūkta (X.90) describes Virāṭ-Puruṣa; Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad presents Virāṭ as cosmic waking state; Bhagavad Gītā chapter XI (Viśvarūpa-darśana-yoga) shows Kṛṣṇa's virāṭa-rūpa; Praśna Upaniṣad discusses Virāṭ; Vedānta-sāra systematizes Virāṭ in cosmic-individual correspondence schema",

Related: viśrānti (repose, cessation), ā-śrama (hermitage, stage of life literally \"without toil\"), pari-śrama (exertion). Pattern: vi-√śram = thorough rest. In spiritual context: viśrāma = the mind resting in Self, cessation of mental activity (vṛtti-nirodha). Bhagavad Gītā: yogastha kuru karmāṇi—act from yoga (inner rest), not agitation. Mnemonic: vi (complete) + śrāma (from śram, toil) → complete rest/repose. True viśrāma is consciousness resting in itself, not merely physical relaxation.",

Mnemonic: viśva (all/universe) + rūpa (form) → form that is the universe = cosmic/universal form. Synonyms: virāṭ-rūpa (cosmic form), viśvamūrti (universal embodiment). Vision of viśvarūpa reveals unity underlying all multiplicity.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: Viśvarūpa is the manifestation of supreme consciousness as the totality of the cosmos; it is Brahman's visible, immanent aspect where the formless takes infinite forms simultaneously; represents the teaching that the universe is not separate from divinity but is divine embodiment; in Vedantic cosmology, viśvarūpa corresponds to Īśvara's creative expression—the One appearing as Many while remaining One; the vision of viśvarūpa dissolves the illusion of separation between God and world\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: Viśvarūpa-darśana is a yogic vision granted by divine grace (prasāda) to qualified devotees; Arjuna required divya-cakṣus (divine eye) to perceive it, showing it transcends ordinary perception; meditation on viśvarūpa expands consciousness from individual to cosmic awareness; practice involves seeing divinity in all forms and beings (sarva-bhūta-darśana); leads to dissolution of ego-boundaries and recognition of universal Self; preparatory to formless non-dual realization\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Viśvarūpa is primarily associated with Kṛṣṇa's revelation in Bhagavad Gītā XI, but also appears as epithet of Viṣṇu, Śiva, Devī, and Brahman; described as having countless faces, eyes, mouths, arms, ornaments; contains all beings, gods, sages, demons, worlds, elements, and time within one cosmic body; simultaneously beautiful and terrifying—shows both creative and destructive aspects; beyond all limited deity-forms while encompassing them all\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Vision of viśvarūpa represents transition from bhakti (devotional dualism) toward jñāna (non-dual knowledge); Arjuna sees that Kṛṣṇa—his friend and charioteer—is identical with the entire universe and its source; overcomes the illusion (māyā) that divinity is separate from creation; teaches that supreme reality is both transcendent (para) and immanent (viśvarūpa); realization of viśvarūpa is seeing \"all this is Brahman\" (sarvam khalv idam brahma); intermediate vision before absolute formless realization\n- **Symbolic Representation**: In Bhagavad Gītā iconography, depicted as overwhelming cosmic vision with infinite forms; shown with multiple heads, arms, eyes radiating in all directions; contains galaxies, suns, moons, fire, oceans, mountains, all beings; time (kāla) with open mouth devouring all; often painted with radiant, sometimes frightening aspects; impossible to capture fully in art—artistic depictions only hint at infinite totality; represents the coincidentia oppositorum (unity of opposites)\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Bhagavad Gītā chapter XI (Viśvarūpa-darśana-yoga) is the primary textual source; also described in Śrīmad Bhāgavata Purāṇa (Kṛṣṇa shows viśvarūpa to Yaśodā and others); Viṣṇu Purāṇa and other Purāṇas elaborate on viśvarūpa; Devī-bhāgavata describes goddess's viśvarūpa; philosophical commentaries by Śaṅkara, Rāmānuja, Madhva interpret the Gītā vision",

  "बुद्धीन्द्रिय": "# बुद्धीन्द्रिय\n**Transliteration**: bud-dhīn-dri-ya\n**POS**: noun (neuter)\n\n**Root Analysis**:\n- This appears to be a variant or error for ज्ञानेन्द्रिय (jñānendriya) \"knowledge-sense\" or बुद्धि (buddhi) + इन्द्रिय (indriya)\n- If बुद्धीन्द्रिय (buddhīndriya): बुद्धि (buddhi) \"intellect, intelligence\" (from √बुध् budh \"to awaken, to know\") + इन्द्रिय (indriya) \"sense organ, faculty\" = \"intellect-organ, cognitive faculty\"\n- इन्द्रिय (indriya) from इन्द्र (indra) \"chief, lord\" + य (ya) suffix = \"belonging to Indra, chief faculty\"\n- Note: Standard term is ज्ञानेन्द्रिय (jñānendriya) \"knowledge-sense\" not buddhīndriya\n\n**Meanings**:\n- Literal: cognitive faculty, intellect-organ, knowledge-sense (non-standard term; likely means jñānendriya)\n- Contextual: in Sāṃkhya and Yoga psychology, the five jñānendriyas (knowledge-senses) are the organs of perception: śrotra (ear/hearing), tvak (skin/touch), cakṣus (eye/sight), rasanā (tongue/taste), ghrāṇa (nose/smell); these are distinguished from the five karmendriyas (action-organs): vāk (speech), pāṇi (hand), pāda (foot), pāyu (excretory), upastha (reproductive); if buddhīndriya is intended, it may conflate buddhi (intellect) with the sense-organs, though buddhi is technically separate as the determinative faculty\n- Symbolic: represents the gateways through which consciousness receives information about the external world; the instruments of knowing\n\n**Learning Tip**:\n- \"Buddhīndriya\" (बुद्धीन्द्रिय) appears non-standard. Standard terms: jñānendriya (ज्ञानेन्द्रिय) = knowledge-sense (5 senses of perception). Buddhi (बुद्धि) = intellect (from √budh, to awaken/know). Indriya (इन्द्रिय) = sense organ, faculty. Five jñānendriyas: (1) śrotra (ear), (2) tvak (skin), (3) cakṣus (eye), (4) rasanā (tongue), (5) ghrāṇa (nose). Opposite: karmendriya (कर्मेन्द्रिय) = action-organ (5 organs of action). In Sāṃkhya: 11 indriyas total = 5 jñānendriyas + 5 karmendriyas + 1 manas (mind). Buddhi is separate from indriyas as the determinative faculty. Mnemonic: jñāna (knowledge) + indriya (sense) → knowledge-sense = organ of perception. May be textual variant or conflation.\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: The jñānendriyas (if this is what's meant) are the five subtle sense-faculties in Sāṃkhya cosmology; they evolve from the tanmātras (subtle elements) and enable the jīva (individual soul) to perceive the manifest world; distinct from gross physical organs, indriyas are subtle faculties; buddhi itself is a higher tattva—the determinative intellect that processes sense-data\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: Control of indriyas is central to yoga practice; pratyāhāra (sense-withdrawal) is the fifth of Patañjali's eight limbs; involves withdrawing the senses from objects (viṣaya) like a tortoise withdrawing its limbs; mastery over indriyas prevents dissipation of consciousness and enables concentration; indriyas are associated with specific cakras and nāḍīs in tantric physiology\n- **Dharmic Significance**: The indriyas are the instruments through which the jīva experiences bondage and, when mastered, liberation; uncontrolled indriyas chase after sense-objects (viṣaya) creating attachment (rāga) and aversion (dveṣa); viveka (discrimination) requires control of indriyas; Kaṭha Upaniṣad uses the chariot metaphor: Ātman is the master, buddhi is the charioteer, manas the reins, indriyas the horses\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Sāṃkhya-kārikā enumerates the tattvas including indriyas; Yoga Sūtra discusses indriya-jaya (mastery of senses) and pratyāhāra; Kaṭha Upaniṣad and Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad describe the hierarchy: Ātman > buddhi > manas > indriyas > viṣayas",

Likely means jñānendriyāṇi (ज्ञानेन्द्रियाणि) = the five knowledge-senses. Nominative/accusative plural neuter: -āṇi ending. The pañca-jñānendriyas (5 knowledge-senses): (1) śrotra/śravaṇa (श्रोत्र, ear/hearing), (2) tvak/sparśana (त्वक्, skin/touch), (3) cakṣus/darśana (चक्षुस्, eye/sight), (4) jihvā/rasanā (जिह्वा/रसना, tongue/taste), (5) ghrāṇa (घ्राण, nose/smell). Each receives its tanmātra (subtle element). Mnemonic device: \"Ears Touch Eyes Taste Nose\" → Śrotra-Tvak-Cakṣus-Rasanā-Ghrāṇa. These 5 + manas (mind) + 5 karmendriyas (action-organs) = 11 indriyas. Pratyāhāra = withdrawal of these from viṣayas (objects).",

Meaning: to grow, increase, expand, strengthen. Brahman is called brahman because it bṛṃhate (expands infinitely) or bṛṃhayati (makes all things grow). Related to English \"bright\" (through expansion of light). Mnemonic: bṛh → expansion/growth → gives Brahman (the ever-expanding reality). Master this root to understand countless Vedic terms!\n\n**Metaphysics**:\n- **Cosmic Role**: √Bṛh represents the fundamental cosmic principle of expansion; Brahman itself is derived from this root, indicating that ultimate reality is characterized by infinite expansion (ananta-vistāra); the universe's expansion from bindu (point) to viśva (all) is the activity of bṛh; in Vedic cosmology, creation is bṛṃhaṇa (expansion) from the unmanifest, and dissolution is saṃhāra (contraction) back to the source; the root embodies the dynamic, ever-growing nature of existence\n- **Energetic/Yogic Application**: In spiritual practice, bṛh represents the expansion of consciousness beyond limited ego-identification; meditation practices aim at citta-vistāra (expansion of mind) through bṛh; as awareness expands (bṛṃhate), it encompasses more until it realizes its identity with infinite Brahman; prāṇāyāma practices involve bṛṃhaṇa (expansion) of prāṇa; the goal is mahattva (greatness) achieved through continuous bṛh\n- **Deity or Energy Form**: Bṛhaspati (Jupiter, guru of the gods) is the deity of this root—he who makes wisdom expand; Brahman as ब्रह्मन् (neuter) derives from √bṛh; the Vedic goddess Bṛhatī personifies expansion; all deities in their cosmic (virāṭ) forms embody bṛh\n- **Mantric Significance**: The syllable BṚṂ contains the root bṛh and is used as bīja for expansion and growth; Gāyatrī mantra addresses Savitr to expand (bṛṃhaya) our wisdom; many Vedic mantras invoke deities to bṛṃhayat (strengthen, increase) devotees\n- **Dharmic Significance**: Brahman is fundamentally defined by √bṛh—it is that which is ever-expanding, limitless, infinite; spiritual evolution is the bṛh (expansion) of limited individual awareness (jīva) until it recognizes its infinite nature (Brahman); mokṣa is the ultimate bṛh where all limitations dissolve into boundlessness; the teaching is that consciousness naturally expands when obstacles (āvaraṇa) are removed\n- **Symbolic Representation**: Represented by expanding circles, ripples spreading outward, the universe emanating from a point; the cosmic egg (hiraṇya-garbha) expanding into manifest creation; symbols of growth like trees, flames reaching upward\n- **Primary Textual Attestation**: Ṛg Veda uses bṛh extensively; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa etymologizes brahman from √bṛh; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (named for its \"great\" bṛhat forest teaching) explores Brahman; Taittirīya Upaniṣad describes Brahman as that from which all beings bṛṃhante (grow); etymological discussions in all major Vedantic commentaries",

Pretya (प्रेत्य) = absolutive of √इ (i, to go) with pra prefix = \"having gone forth, after departing\" (euphemism for death). Abhāva (अभाव) = a (not) + bhāva (existence) = non-existence, absence, cessation. Siddha (सिद्ध) = accomplished, perfected (from √सिध् sidh). Contrast: pretya-bhāva (प्रेत्य-भाव) = existence after death = rebirth vs. pretya-abhāva (प्रेत्य-अभाव) = non-existence after death = liberation. Famous Upaniṣadic phrase: \"na pretya saṁjñāsti\" (there is no individual consciousness after death [for the liberated]). Mnemonic: \"pretya\" (departed) + \"a-bhāva\" (non-being) + \"siddha\" (accomplished) = accomplished in non-return after death = liberated."

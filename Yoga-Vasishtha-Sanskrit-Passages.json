The archaic spelling (धर्म्म with doubled म instead of modern धर्म) reflects the manuscript tradition of this ancient text.\n\n**Key Terms**:\n- **धर्म्म (dharma)**: From the root √धृ (dhṛ, \"to uphold, sustain\"), dharma encompasses righteous duty, moral law, the inherent nature of things, and the cosmic order that sustains reality. In Advaita Vedānta, it often refers to svadharma (one's own nature) and the practices that align one with Truth.\n\n- **कर्म्म (karma)**: From √कृ (kṛ, \"to do, make, act\"), karma denotes action, deed, ritual performance, and the law of cause and effect. Beyond mere physical action, it includes mental actions (thoughts) and volitional impulses, all of which generate saṃskāras (impressions) that bind consciousness to the cycle of becoming.\n\n**Philosophical Notes**:\n\nYoga Vasishtha treats dharma and karma not as separate domains but as intimately interconnected aspects of the seeker's journey toward liberation (mokṣa). Unlike purely devotional or ritualistic texts, YV approaches these concepts through the lens of jñāna-yoga (the path of knowledge), examining how both dharma and karma relate to the fundamental ignorance (avidyā) that obscures the Self.\n\nThe juxtaposition of these two terms signals a discussion of one of Indian philosophy's central paradoxes: How does one act (karma) while simultaneously recognizing the actionless nature of the Self (ātman)? Yoga Vasishtha's sophisticated answer involves the doctrine of jīvanmukti (liberation while living), where one performs dharma-aligned actions while maintaining unbroken awareness of the non-dual Reality.\n\nIn YV's framework, dharma represents not external obligation but the spontaneous expression of wisdom. When consciousness recognizes its true nature through viveka (discrimination), actions naturally align with cosmic order without personal agency or attachment. This transforms karma from binding action into what the Bhagavad Gītā calls karma-yoga—action that liberates rather than binds.\n\nThe text emphasizes that both dharma and karma are ultimately phenomena within the dream of manifestation (jagat-svapna). From the absolute standpoint (pāramārthika), the Self neither acts nor has duties. Yet from the relative standpoint (vyāvahārika), wise engagement with dharma and skillful relationship to karma serve as upāyas (means) for purifying the mind and preparing it for the recognition of Truth.\n\n**Practical Application**:\n\nFor the practitioner, this heading introduces teachings on navigating the paradox of engaged living while pursuing liberation. The student learns to discern which actions are dharma-aligned (those arising from wisdom, compassion, and recognition of unity) versus those driven by vāsanās (mental impressions and desires) that perpetuate bondage.\n\nThe practice involves cultivating sakṣi-bhāva (witness consciousness)—performing necessary actions while maintaining awareness that the true Self is the unchanging witness, untouched by the play of dharma and karma. This transforms daily life into sādhana, where every action becomes an opportunity to recognize the actionless Self behind all doing.\n\n**Cross-References**:\n- **Bhagavad Gītā 3.19-20**: Krishna's teaching on performing dharma without attachment, acting for loka-saṅgraha (welfare of the world) while established in Self-knowledge\n- **Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.22**: \"Having realized the Self, what deed would one do?\"—the resolution of action in Self-knowledge\n- **YV's doctrine of līlā**: Actions of the wise as spontaneous play rather than binding karma\n- **Śaṅkara's commentary on Brahma-sūtra 3.4.26-27**: Discussion of whether the liberated sage has duties (vidvat-karma)",
  "5b819ac8b373": "# Sanskrit Passage\n\nआत्मानात्म विवेक\n\n## Translation\n\nDiscrimination between Self and Not-Self (ātmānātma-viveka)\n\n## Commentary\n\n**Context**: This technical term represents one of the four qualifications (sādhana-catuṣṭaya) essential for Advaita Vedānta study and practice. In Yoga Vasishtha, this discrimination forms the foundational method through which Rāma is guided from confusion (moha) to clarity (viveka) and ultimately to liberation (mokṣa). The compound appears throughout YV as both a philosophical principle and a practical contemplative technique.\n\n**Key Terms**:\n- **आत्मन् (ātman)**: The Self, pure consciousness, the unchanging witness (sākṣin), one's true nature which is identical with Brahman. From √an (\"to breathe\"), it denotes the animating principle, but in Advaita philosophy transcends mere vitality to indicate the absolute reality of pure awareness.\n\n- **अनात्मन् (anātman)**: The not-self, everything that is not the Self—including body (śarīra), senses (indriyas), mind (manas), intellect (buddhi), and all objective phenomena. The prefix \"an-\" negates ātman, indicating all that appears but is not the unchanging reality.\n\n- **विवेक (viveka)**: Discrimination, discernment, the capacity to distinguish the real from the unreal (satya-asatya), the eternal from the ephemeral (nitya-anitya). From vi-√vic (\"to separate, distinguish\"), it represents not mere intellectual knowledge but direct penetrating insight that cuts through confusion.\n\n**Philosophical Notes**:\n\nĀtmānātma-viveka stands as the central practice in Yoga Vasishtha's methodology for liberation. Unlike paths emphasizing devotion (bhakti) or ritual action (karma), YV places discriminative inquiry at the heart of spiritual practice. This viveka is not a one-time intellectual understanding but a continuous practice of distinguishing consciousness from its contents, awareness from its objects.\n\nThe practice operates on multiple levels simultaneously. At the gross level, one discriminates consciousness from the physical body—recognizing \"I am not this body which is born, ages, and dies.\" At the subtle level, one separates awareness from mental phenomena—thoughts, emotions, memories, and perceptions. At the causal level, one distinguishes the witness from the very sense of individual personhood (ahaṃkāra), recognizing even the \"I-thought\" as an object appearing in consciousness.\n\nYoga Vasishtha's unique contribution lies in its teaching that this discrimination reveals not merely conceptual understanding but direct recognition (pratyabhijñā) of what one has always been. The Self is never truly obscured; only the habitual identification (abhimāna) with not-self creates the appearance of bondage. Through sustained viveka, these false identifications dissolve like mist before the sun, revealing the ever-present reality of pure consciousness.\n\nThe text emphasizes that viveka is both the means (upāya) and the fruit (phala) of practice. Initially cultivated as deliberate inquiry, it gradually becomes one's natural way of seeing, culminating in sahaja-avasthā (the natural state) where discrimination becomes effortless recognition. At this stage, the liberated sage (jīvanmukta) spontaneously perceives all phenomena as mere appearances in the Self, without the need for active discrimination.\n\nCritically, YV warns against viveka becoming mere intellectual gymnastics. True discrimination arises from vairāgya (dispassion) and leads to deeper vairāgya in a virtuous cycle. It must be grounded in direct observation (sākṣāt-kāra) rather than conceptual thinking, transforming one's fundamental relationship to experience rather than adding more thoughts about reality.\n\n**Practical Application**:\n\nThe practitioner begins by establishing the foundational discrimination: consciousness is aware of the body, therefore consciousness cannot be the body. This inquiry extends systematically: \"Who is aware of this thought? Who observes this emotion? Who witnesses this sense of 'I'?\" Each question redirects attention from objects to the witnessing awareness itself.\n\nIn daily life, viveka transforms every experience into spiritual practice. When pain arises, one practices: \"I am aware of pain, therefore I am not pain.\" When desires emerge: \"I observe this desire, therefore I am not this desire.\" Gradually, this shifts one's identity from the ever-changing contents of experience to the unchanging awareness within which all experience appears.\n\nYV recommends specific contemplations to deepen viveka: reflecting on the three states (waking, dream, deep sleep) to recognize the consciousness that remains constant through all states; examining the witness of thoughts to discover awareness beyond mental activity; investigating the sense of \"I\" to find what remains when all objective identity is set aside.\n\nThe practice requires patience and persistence. The mind habitually returns to identifying with not-self due to vāsanās (deep impressions). Yet each moment of clear discrimination weakens these patterns, gradually establishing one in ātma-niṣṭhā (abidance in the Self).\n\n**Cross-References**:\n- **Vivekacūḍāmaṇi verses 190-210**: Śaṅkara's systematic teaching on ātmānātma-viveka as the foundation of liberation\n- **Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.4.10**: \"I am Brahman\" (aham brahmāsmi) as the culmination of discrimination\n- **Bhagavad Gītā 2.16-25**: The discrimination between the real and unreal, the eternal Self and perishable body\n- **Māṇḍūkya Kārikā 1.6-9**: Gauḍapāda's analysis of the witness-consciousness (turīya) distinct from all states\n- **YV Book 6 (Nirvāṇa Prakaraṇa)**: Extended teachings on viveka as the direct path to liberation\n- **Advaita Mahātmyas**: The four qualifications (sādhana-catuṣṭaya) where viveka is listed as the first essential quality",
  "3cc7a2a4cebb": "# Sanskrit Passage\n\nजीवात्मा परमात्मा ज्ञान\n\n## Translation\n\nKnowledge of the Individual Self and the Supreme Self (jīvātmā-paramātmā-jñāna)\n\n## Commentary\n\n**Context**: This phrase encapsulates one of the most fundamental inquiries in Advaita Vedānta: the relationship between the apparently limited individual consciousness (jīva) and the unlimited absolute consciousness (Brahman/Paramātman). In Yoga Vasishtha, this teaching addresses the central confusion that creates bondage—the apparent duality between the experiencer and the absolute reality—and points toward their essential non-difference (abheda).\n\n**Key Terms**:\n- **जीवात्मा (jīvātman)**: The individual self or soul; the consciousness apparently limited by and identified with a particular body-mind complex. From jīva (\"living being\") + ātman (\"self\"), it denotes the empirical self that experiences the world, performs actions, and undergoes karma. In truth, it is Brahman appearing to be limited through the conditioning of upādhis (limiting adjuncts).\n\n- **परमात्मा (paramātman)**: The Supreme Self, the absolute reality, identical with Brahman. From parama (\"supreme, highest\") + ātman, it indicates consciousness in its unconditioned, infinite nature—free from all limitations of space, time, and causation. It is the eternal witness (sākṣin), pure existence-consciousness-bliss (sat-cit-ānanda).\n\n- **ज्ञान (jñāna)**: Knowledge, wisdom; specifically the direct non-dual knowledge (aparokṣa-jñāna) that reveals reality. From √jñā (\"to know\"), in this context it doesn't mean intellectual information but the transformative recognition (pratyabhijñā) that dissolves the illusion of separation between jīva and Brahman.\n\n**Philosophical Notes**:\n\nThis heading introduces what Yoga Vasishtha considers the ultimate knowledge: the recognition that jīvātman and paramātman are not two separate realities but one consciousness appearing as two through ignorance (avidyā). The text employs the classic Vedāntic teaching of \"tat tvam asi\" (thou art that)—the jīva is essentially none other than Brahman, like space in a pot is none other than infinite space.\n\nThe apparent difference between jīvātman and paramātman arises solely through upādhis—the limiting conditions of body, mind, and ego-sense. Just as the same sun reflected in many water vessels appears as multiple suns, the one paramātman reflected in countless body-mind complexes appears as multiple jīvas. The reflections seem separate, but their essential nature remains the one light.\n\nYoga Vasishtha's distinctive approach emphasizes that this knowledge is not something to be attained in the future but a recognition of what has always been true. The jīva has never actually been separate from paramātman; separation exists only in erroneous perception, like mistaking a rope for a snake. The rope was never a snake, even during the misperception. Similarly, the jīva was never truly separate from Brahman, even during the appearance of individual existence.\n\nThe text addresses a critical question: If jīvātman and paramātman are identical, why doesn't everyone realize this immediately? YV explains through the concept of vāsanās (mental impressions) and saṃskāras (deep conditioning) that create the habitual sense of being a limited individual. These impressions, accumulated through beginningless ignorance, veil the ever-present truth. Jñāna burns away these impressions like fire consuming fuel, revealing what was never actually hidden.\n\nThis jñāna operates as both realization and dissolution. It is the recognition of what one is (pure consciousness, paramātman) and simultaneously the dissolution of what one is not (the limited jīva-identity). In this knowledge, questions like \"what happens to the jīva after liberation?\" are revealed as meaningless—there never was a separate jīva to undergo transformation; there was only paramātman appearing to itself as separate due to the superimposition of limitations.\n\n**Practical Application**:\n\nThe cultivation of jīvātmā-paramātmā-jñāna involves both study (śravaṇa), contemplation (manana), and profound meditation (nididhyāsana). The student begins by receiving the teaching: \"You are not the limited body-mind; you are the infinite consciousness.\" This is not merely conceptual learning but the planting of a seed that will undermine all false identifications.\n\nContemplation deepens this understanding by examining one's direct experience. In deep sleep, the jīva-sense dissolves yet consciousness persists—what is that consciousness? When witnessing thoughts arise and pass, what is the unchanging awareness that observes them? Through such inquiry, one begins to taste the distinction between the conditioned jīva-appearance and the unconditioned paramātman-reality.\n\nThe ultimate practice is abidance (niṣṭhā) in this knowledge. Rather than maintaining the jīva-identity and trying to unite with paramātman, one rests in the recognition: \"I am already and always paramātman; the jīva-sense is a mere appearance within me.\" This is not a state to achieve but the natural reality to recognize, like the space in a pot recognizing it was never different from infinite space.\n\nYV emphasizes that this knowledge must become lived reality (jīvanmukti), not mere philosophy. The liberated sage continues to function in the world—the body-mind complex continues—but there is no identification with it. Like an actor who knows the role is not his true identity, the jñānī engages with life while established in the knowledge: \"I am paramātman; these appearances of jīva and world are like waves on the ocean of consciousness that I am.\"\n\n**Cross-References**:\n- **Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.8.7**: The famous \"tat tvam asi\" teaching—the identity of individual and cosmic Self\n- **Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.5**: \"This Self is Brahman\" (ayam ātmā brahma)—the direct equation\n- **Bhagavad Gītā 13.1-2**: Krishna's teaching on the field (kṣetra/body-mind) and the knower of the field (kṣetrajña/ātman)\n- **Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad with Kārikā**: Gauḍapāda's analysis of how jīva and jagat are māyā-projections of Brahman\n- **Vivekacūḍāmaṇi verses 243-250**: Śaṅkara's exposition on the five sheaths (pañca-kośa) concealing paramātman's identity with jīva\n- **YV's teaching on dṛśya-vilaya**: The dissolution of all objective phenomena in the recognition of pure consciousness",
  "9afc7ba58c85": "# Sanskrit Passage\n\nपरम निःश्रेयस्\n\n## Translation\n\nThe Supreme Good; The Highest Liberation (parama-niḥśreyasa)\n\n## Commentary\n\n**Context**: This compound term represents the ultimate goal (puruṣārtha) toward which all of Yoga Vasishtha's teachings are directed. It appears in contexts where Vasiṣṭha distinguishes between mere worldly happiness (preyas, \"the pleasant\") and the highest good (śreyas, \"the beneficial\"), with parama-niḥśreyasa indicating the absolute, unsurpassable benefit—liberation from all suffering and the realization of one's true nature as infinite consciousness.\n\n**Key Terms**:\n- **परम (parama)**: Supreme, highest, ultimate, transcendent. From the superlative of para (\"beyond\"), it indicates what surpasses all else, the final end beyond which nothing exists. In philosophical contexts, it denotes the absolute as opposed to the relative, the unconditioned as opposed to the conditioned.\n\n- **निःश्रेयस् (niḥśreyasa)**: The highest good, supreme welfare, ultimate benefit. From निः (niḥ, \"completely, absolutely\") + श्रेयस् (śreyasa, \"better, beneficial\"), it represents what is unqualifiedly good—not a comparative good but the absolute good beyond all comparison. In classical Indian philosophy, this specifically denotes mokṣa (liberation) as opposed to worldly goods like wealth, pleasure, or even heaven.\n\n**Philosophical Notes**:\n\nYoga Vasishtha employs parama-niḥśreyasa to designate the end of all seeking—the recognition of one's nature as Brahman. Unlike temporary goods that eventually lead to further desiring, this supreme good is characterized by complete fulfillment (pūrṇatva). Once realized, nothing remains to be attained, no desire persists, no lack can arise. It is the absolute cessation of all suffering (duḥkha) not through acquiring something new but through recognizing what has always been present.\n\nThe text makes a crucial distinction that runs through Indian spiritual philosophy: the difference between preyas (what is immediately pleasant but ultimately harmful) and śreyas (what may require effort but leads to lasting benefit). Worldly pleasures, achievements, even heavenly rewards fall into the category of preyas—they may bring temporary satisfaction but perpetuate the cycle of desire, action, and rebirth (saṃsāra). Niḥśreyasa represents śreyas in its absolute form—the good that ends all seeking because it reveals the seeker's essential wholeness.\n\nWhat makes this \"supreme\" (parama) is its unconditioned nature. Ordinary goods depend on circumstances—wealth can be lost, health can fail, relationships can end, even heavenly enjoyments exhaust their karmic merit. Parama-niḥśreyasa, being the recognition of one's nature as unchanging consciousness, cannot be gained or lost, enhanced or diminished. It is discovering what one has always been, like space discovering it was never truly confined by the pot's walls.\n\nYoga Vasishtha's teaching methodology consistently points toward this supreme good as the resolution of Rāma's fundamental confusion. Rāma's vairāgya (dispassion) arises from recognizing that all conditioned goods are ephemeral and ultimately unsatisfying. Yet mere renunciation is insufficient—one must realize the positive content of parama-niḥśreyasa: the infinite being-consciousness-bliss (sat-cit-ānanda) that one is. This is not nihilistic negation but the fullest possible affirmation, the recognition of limitless existence as one's own true nature.\n\nThe text emphasizes that this supreme good is not reserved for a distant future or some special beings. It is the birth-right of every consciousness, always available, obscured only by ignorance (avidyā) and the accumulation of vāsanās (mental impressions). The path to parama-niḥśreyasa is therefore not one of attainment but of recognition, not of becoming but of being.\n\n**Practical Application**:\n\nUnderstanding parama-niḥśreyasa transforms one's entire orientation to life and practice. The spiritual seeker learns to distinguish between what merely satisfies immediate cravings (preyas) and what conduces to the highest good (śreyas). This discrimination (viveka) becomes the compass guiding all choices—not through harsh renunciation but through clear seeing of what truly benefits.\n\nIn daily practice, one repeatedly turns attention from ephemeral goods toward the eternal. When desires arise, rather than suppressing them, one inquires: \"Will fulfilling this desire bring me to parama-niḥśreyasa, or merely perpetuate seeking?\" This inquiry doesn't deny legitimate needs but prevents the endless multiplication of wants driven by the illusion that satisfaction lies in objects rather than in recognizing one's complete nature.\n\nThe cultivation of vairāgya (dispassion) serves parama-niḥśreyasa not by making life gray and joyless but by freeing attention from endless chasing of conditions. As the Kaṭha Upaniṣad teaches, the wise choose śreyas over preyas. This choice becomes natural as one tastes the peace of resting in awareness itself rather than constantly seeking fulfillment in experience.\n\nYV emphasizes that the pursuit of parama-niḥśreyasa is the most practical undertaking possible. All other pursuits can be lost to time, death, or circumstance. Only the realization of one's true nature as infinite consciousness cannot be taken away, because it is the discovery of what one has always been. Thus, establishing oneself in this supreme good is not escaping life but discovering the unshakeable foundation of peace that allows one to engage life fully without existential anxiety.\n\n**Cross-References**:\n- **Kaṭha Upaniṣad 1.2.1-2**: Naciketas's choice of śreyas over preyas, the eternal over the pleasant\n- **Bhagavad Gītā 2.14**: Krishna's teaching to transcend temporary pleasures and pains to attain the eternal\n- **Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad 1.2.12**: \"Having examined the worlds won by action, the wise one attains dispassion.

  "456deb063a38": "# Sanskrit Passage\n\nचित्त प्रशान्ति\n\n## Translation\n\nTranquility of Mind; Peace of Consciousness (citta-praśānti)\n\n## Commentary\n\n**Context**: This compound represents both a crucial prerequisite for spiritual realization and a natural consequence of Self-knowledge in Yoga Vasishtha's teaching framework. Vasiṣṭha frequently emphasizes that citta-praśānti is essential for the mind to reflect truth clearly, like a still pond reflects the moon perfectly while a disturbed pond creates distorted images. The term appears in discussions of mental purification (citta-śuddhi) and the qualities of a mature seeker.\n\n**Key Terms**:\n- **चित्त (citta)**: Mind-stuff, consciousness in its conditioned aspect, the field of mental modifications. From √cit (\"to perceive, be conscious\"), it encompasses the thinking faculty (manas), the discriminative intellect (buddhi), the ego-sense (ahaṃkāra), and the storehouse of impressions (citta proper). Unlike pure consciousness (caitanya), citta is consciousness as modified by thoughts, memories, and latent tendencies.\n\n- **प्रशान्ति (praśānti)**: Complete tranquility, profound peace, thorough quietude. From प्र (pra, intensive prefix) + शान्ति (śānti, \"peace, cessation\"), it indicates not mere temporary calm but deep, abiding stillness. The prefix \"pra-\" emphasizes fullness and completion—this is peace perfected, the utter subsidence of all mental agitation.\n\n**Philosophical Notes**:\n\nYoga Vasishtha teaches that citta-praśānti is simultaneously a practice and a realization. As practice, it involves the deliberate calming of mental modifications (vṛtti-nirodha) through discrimination (viveka) and dispassion (vairāgya). As realization, it is the natural state that emerges when consciousness recognizes its true nature and ceases identifying with the mind's movements. Thus citta-praśānti is both the path and the destination, the means and the fruit.\n\nThe text distinguishes this profound tranquility from mere mental dullness (tamas) or forced suppression. True praśānti arises from understanding, not from repressing mental energy. When the mind sees through the illusory nature of objects that previously agitated it—desires, fears, attachments—those objects lose their power to disturb. The peace that follows is not an achievement but a revelation of what remains when false pursuits cease.\n\nYV analyzes the mechanism of mental disturbance with precision: the mind becomes agitated through rāga-dveṣa (attraction and aversion), which arise from the mistaken belief that objects possess the power to complete or diminish one's essential being. When viveka reveals that one's nature is already complete (pūrṇa) as pure consciousness, objects lose their compelling power. Desires may still arise, but they no longer create the intense craving and anxiety that characterize the bound mind. This is citta-praśānti—not the absence of mental movement but freedom from compulsive reactivity.\n\nThe relationship between citta-praśānti and jñāna (liberating knowledge) is reciprocal. Some degree of mental peace is necessary to receive and contemplate spiritual teachings—an agitated mind cannot sustain the subtle discrimination required for Self-inquiry. Yet the deeper one's understanding of non-dual truth, the more profound one's mental tranquility becomes. This creates a virtuous spiral: peace enables insight, insight deepens peace, until the artificial distinction between practice and realization dissolves.\n\nCrucially, Yoga Vasishtha emphasizes that citta-praśānti doesn't mean withdrawal from life or suppression of natural responses. The liberated sage's mind remains functional, responsive, even playful—but it rests in an underlying stillness like the ocean depths that remain calm regardless of surface waves. This is praśānti as stability (sthiratva) rather than inertia, as dynamic equilibrium rather than static suppression.\n\n**Practical Application**:\n\nCultivating citta-praśānti begins with recognizing what disturbs the mind. The practitioner observes: anxiety arises when imagining future scenarios, anger when replaying past grievances, craving when projecting satisfaction onto objects. Each disturbance reveals an underlying assumption—that happiness depends on external conditions, that one's essential nature is inadequate and needs completion. By questioning these assumptions through viveka, their power to agitate diminishes.\n\nSpecific practices support this cultivation. Vairāgya (dispassion) reduces the mind's tendency to compulsively reach outward for satisfaction. Sama (mental evenness) develops equanimity toward pleasant and unpleasant experiences. Uparati (cessation) involves stepping back from the habitual pursuit of stimulation, allowing the mind to discover its natural restful state. These practices don't force peace but remove the obstacles that obscure the mind's inherent tranquility.\n\nYV recommends contemplating the impermanent nature of all objects and experiences. When the mind truly grasps that everything it chases or fears is ephemeral, those things lose their power to create lasting disturbance. This isn't nihilistic depression but the clear-eyed recognition that enables genuine peace—not the fragile peace that depends on favorable conditions but the unshakeable peace rooted in understanding.\n\nThe ultimate practice is abiding in witness-consciousness (sākṣi-bhāva). Rather than identifying with mental movements, one rests as the awareness that observes them. Thoughts may arise and pass, emotions may flow, but the witnessing awareness remains undisturbed, like the screen that remains untouched by the images projected upon it. Establishing oneself in this witnessing position is the perfection of citta-praśānti.\n\n**Cross-References**:\n- **Patañjali's Yoga Sūtra 1.2**: \"yogaś citta-vṛtti-nirodhaḥ\" (yoga is the cessation of mental modifications)—the foundation for citta-praśānti\n- **Bhagavad Gītā 2.54-55**: Arjuna's question about the sthita-prajña (one of steady wisdom) whose mind remains undisturbed\n- **Bhagavad Gītā 6.19**: The simile of a lamp in a windless place, illustrating the still mind in meditation\n- **Kaṭha Upaniṣad 1.3.10-11**: Control of mind and senses as prerequisite for realizing the Self\n- **Vivekacūḍāmaṇi verse 27**: Śama (mental tranquility) as one of the six treasures (ṣaṭ-sampatti) required for liberation\n- **YV's teaching on manolaya vs. mano-nāśa**: Temporary mental suppression versus the permanent dissolution of mind through knowledge",
  "32426d8b226c": "# Sanskrit Passage\n\nमिथ्या दृष्टि\n\n## Translation\n\nFalse Vision; Erroneous Perception (mithyā-dṛṣṭi)\n\n## Commentary\n\n**Context**: This term identifies the fundamental error that creates bondage in Yoga Vasishtha's teaching. Mithyā-dṛṣṭi is the mistaken perception that takes the unreal for the real, the impermanent for the permanent, consciousness for its modifications, the Self for the not-self. Vasiṣṭha employs this concept to explain how ignorance (avidyā) operates—not as the absence of knowledge but as positive misknowledge, seeing things wrongly rather than not seeing at all.\n\n**Key Terms**:\n- **मिथ्या (mithyā)**: False, illusory, apparently real but ultimately unreal. From the root मिथ् (mith, \"falsely, wrongly\"), it denotes what appears to exist independently but actually depends on something else for its appearance. In Advaita, mithyā describes the ontological status of the world—neither completely real (sat) nor completely unreal (asat), but dependent reality, like a rope-snake or dream-objects.\n\n- **दृष्टि (dṛṣṭi)**: Vision, perception, viewpoint, way of seeing. From √dṛś (\"to see\"), it encompasses both sensory perception and cognitive understanding. In philosophical contexts, dṛṣṭi indicates one's fundamental orientation toward reality—the lens through which experience is interpreted. Wrong dṛṣṭi creates bondage; right dṛṣṭi (samyag-dṛṣṭi) leads to liberation.\n\n**Philosophical Notes**:\n\nYoga Vasishtha's analysis of mithyā-dṛṣṭi reveals the mechanics of bondage with surgical precision. The error is not in perception itself but in interpretation. The senses report accurately—colors, sounds, sensations occur. The mistake lies in superimposing reality and independence onto these appearances, taking ephemeral modifications of consciousness as substantial, separate entities. This is adhyāsa (superimposition), projecting attributes of one thing onto another, like seeing silver in mother-of-pearl.\n\nThe text identifies several layers of mithyā-dṛṣṭi. Most fundamentally, consciousness mistakes itself for the body-mind complex, creating the sense \"I am this limited form.\" This primary misidentification spawns secondary errors: \"This body is me, these thoughts are me, this gender/age/nationality is my true nature.\" Each layer of false identification creates corresponding desires and fears, weaving the web of saṃsāra.\n\nCrucially, YV teaches that mithyā-dṛṣṭi is not merely intellectual error but existential confusion affecting every moment of experience. One doesn't consciously think \"I am the body\"; rather, this assumption operates as the unexamined background of all activity. Like someone dreaming who doesn't question the dream-reality until waking, the person in mithyā-dṛṣṭi doesn't recognize their confusion until discriminative wisdom (viveka) reveals it.\n\nThe text draws a vital distinction between mithyā (dependent reality) and tuccha (absolute unreality, like a square circle). The world is mithyā—it appears, functions, but lacks independent existence. Only Brahman is satyam (absolutely real). Understanding this prevents two errors: the materialist mistake (treating the world as ultimately real) and the nihilist mistake (treating the world as completely unreal). Mithyā occupies the middle position: real enough to be experienced, unreal enough to be transcended.\n\nYoga Vasishtha emphasizes that correcting mithyā-dṛṣṭi doesn't require acquiring new perceptions but recognizing what's already present. Just as the rope was always rope even while seen as snake, Brahman is always present even while misperceived as limited jīva and world. Liberation (mokṣa) is not gaining something absent but removing the false vision that obscures what has never truly been hidden.\n\n**Practical Application**:\n\nRecognizing mithyā-dṛṣṭi begins with noticing how perceptions automatically trigger interpretations. When seeing a desired object, notice the immediate assumption: \"That will make me happy.\" This assumption reveals mithyā-dṛṣṭi—projecting completeness onto an external object, as if happiness were a property of things rather than your own nature as pure consciousness.\n\nThe practice involves systematic questioning of habitual interpretations. \"I am the body\"—but awareness persists through bodily changes; what is this unchanging awareness? \"I am the mind\"—but consciousness witnesses mental states; what is this witnessing presence? Each question chips away at false identifications, gradually revealing the distinction between what you are (witnessing consciousness) and what you erroneously take yourself to be (objects of consciousness).\n\nYV recommends contemplating the three states (waking, dream, deep sleep) to expose mithyā-dṛṣṭi. In dreams, one completely believes in the dream-world's reality, mistaking it for substantial existence. Upon waking, the error becomes obvious—the dream was mithyā, appearing real but lacking independent existence. Similarly, from the standpoint of Self-knowledge, the waking world is recognized as mithyā, appearing but not ultimately real.\n\nThe correction of mithyā-dṛṣṭi doesn't require rejecting appearances but seeing through them. Forms continue appearing, but one recognizes them as consciousness manifesting various patterns, like ocean recognizing waves as its own modifications. This is samyag-dṛṣṭi (right vision)—not seeing different objects but seeing differently, perceiving the one reality behind all appearances.\n\n**Cross-References**:\n- **Bhagavad Gītā 2.16**: \"The unreal has no being; the real never ceases to be\"—the fundamental discrimination between sat and asat that corrects mithyā-dṛṣṭi\n- **Bhagavad Gītā 18.20-22**: Krishna's teaching on the three types of knowledge (sāttvika, rājasa, tāmasa), where tāmasa knowledge sees multiplicity as ultimate truth—a form of mithyā-dṛṣṭi\n- **Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.1.4**: Uddalaka's teaching to Śvetaketu: \"By knowing one lump of clay, all clay objects are known\"—revealing the mithyā nature of names and forms\n- **Māṇḍūkya Kārikā 2.12**: Gauḍapāda's analysis of dream showing how false perception creates an apparently real world\n- **Vivekacūḍāmaṇi verses 110-111**: Śaṅkara's exposition on adhyāsa (superimposition) as the root error\n- **YV's rope-snake analogy**: The classic example of mithyā-perception—the rope appears as snake due to dim lighting (ignorance), yet the rope's nature never actually changed",
  "7271ab042d93": "# Sanskrit Passage\n\nऋषयो वा इन्द्रं प्रत्यक्षं नापश्यन् । तं वशिष्ठः प्रत्यक्षमपश्यत् ।\nसोऽब्रवीत् ब्रह्माणं ते वक्ष्यामि । यथात्वत् पुरोहिताः प्रजाः प्रजनिष्यन्ते ।\n\n## Translation\n\nThe sages did not see Indra directly. But Vasiṣṭha saw him directly.\nHe said: \"I shall teach you about Brahman, so that you, as spiritual guides, may generate offspring.\"\n\n## Commentary\n\n**Context**: This passage appears to recount a mythological episode establishing Vasiṣṭha's spiritual authority and his role as teacher. The narrative structure follows a common Vedic pattern: the sages (ṛṣis) seek divine knowledge, encounter obstacles in their vision, and rely on one supremely qualified teacher who possesses direct realization (pratyakṣa) to transmit the teaching. This framing establishes the lineage and authenticity of the Yoga Vasishtha's teachings, positioning Vasiṣṭha as one who has immediate, unmediated knowledge of reality rather than mere secondhand learning.\n\n**Key Terms**:\n- **ऋषयः (ṛṣayaḥ)**: The seers, sages; those to whom the Vedas were revealed. From √ṛṣ (\"to flow, go, move\"), they are visionaries who perceive truth directly through inner illumination. In the Vedic tradition, ṛṣis are not mere scholars but realized beings whose consciousness has become a clear channel for transcendent knowledge.\n\n- **इन्द्र (Indra)**: The king of the gods in Vedic mythology, wielder of the thunderbolt (vajra), slayer of Vṛtra. While often understood mythologically, in Advaita exegesis, Indra frequently symbolizes the supreme Self, pure consciousness, or the cosmic intelligence. The name derives from roots suggesting power, sovereignty, and light.\n\n- **प्रत्यक्ष (pratyakṣa)**: Direct perception, immediate apprehension, seeing face-to-face. From प्रति (prati, \"towards\") + अक्ष (akṣa, \"eye, sense\"), it indicates knowledge gained through direct experience rather than inference or testimony. In spiritual contexts, pratyakṣa refers to aparokṣa-jñāna—immediate, non-dual realization as opposed to parokṣa (indirect, mediated knowledge).\n\n- **वशिष्ठ (Vasiṣṭha)**: One of the seven great sages (saptarṣi), royal preceptor (rāja-guru) to the solar dynasty, and the speaker in Yoga Vasishtha. The name derives from vasiṣṭha (\"most excellent, richest\"), indicating his supreme spiritual attainment. In YV, he represents the perfected sage who has realized Brahman and can guide others to that realization.\n\n- **ब्रह्माण् (brahmāṇa)**: Brahman, the absolute reality, the infinite existence-consciousness-bliss (sat-cit-ānanda). From √bṛh (\"to expand, grow\"), Brahman is that which is limitless, the ground of all existence, beyond all categories and qualifications.\n\n- **पुरोहिताः (purohitāḥ)**: Spiritual guides, priests who go before (puras) and offer (hu) sacrifices on behalf of others; those who stand in front to lead the way. In this context, it suggests the ṛṣis' role as teachers and guides for subsequent generations, mediators between the transcendent and the manifest.\n\n- **प्रजाः (prajāḥ)**: Offspring, progeny, students, those generated forth. From प्र (pra, \"forth\") + √jan (\"to generate\"), it can mean biological descendants or, more pertinently in spiritual contexts, students, disciples, those to whom knowledge is transmitted.\n\n**Philosophical Notes**:\n\nThis passage establishes a crucial epistemological hierarchy that pervades Vedāntic teaching: the distinction between indirect knowledge (parokṣa-jñāna) and direct realization (pratyakṣa-jñāna or aparokṣa-jñāna). The other sages did not see Indra directly—their knowledge remained conceptual, based on scripture and inference. Vasiṣṭha alone possessed immediate realization, having transcended the mediated understanding that characterizes ordinary consciousness.\n\nThe seeing of Indra \"directly\" (pratyakṣam) functions on multiple levels. Exoterically, it describes a visionary experience where Vasiṣṭha perceived the deity while others could not. Esoterically, within YV's non-dual framework, it symbolizes direct realization of the Self. Indra, as king of the gods, represents consciousness in its lordly aspect—awareness that illuminates all experience yet remains untouched by it. The other sages, despite their learning and spiritual practice, had not yet achieved this immediate recognition. Only Vasiṣṭha had crossed the threshold from knowing about reality to being established in reality.\n\nThis distinction parallels the Upaniṣadic teaching of the two types of knowledge: aparā vidyā (lower knowledge) consisting of the Vedas, sciences, and all objective knowledge; and parā vidyā (higher knowledge) by which the imperishable Brahman is realized. The sages possessed aparā vidyā in abundance—they knew the scriptures, performed the rituals, understood the cosmic order. But parā vidyā, direct non-dual realization, remained beyond their grasp until Vasiṣṭha, possessing it, could transmit it.\n\nVasiṣṭha's promise to teach about Brahman (brahmāṇaṃ te vakṣyāmi) carries profound significance. He does not merely promise information about Brahman but the means to direct realization. The purpose clause—\"so that you may generate offspring\"—operates on two levels. Literally, as purohitas (family priests), they would guide the reproductive and ritual life of householders. Spiritually, they would generate spiritual offspring—students who would receive the liberating knowledge and carry it forward through time.\n\nThe passage implicitly addresses the paradox of teaching Brahman. How can that which is beyond words be taught? How can the infinite be conveyed through finite concepts? YV's answer, embodied in this episode, is that teaching serves not to convey Brahman as an object but to remove obstacles to its recognition. The teacher who has direct realization can skillfully guide students to their own immediate apprehension, not by transferring knowledge as one pours water from one vessel to another, but by removing the ignorance that obscures the ever-present truth.\n\nThis narrative also establishes the guru-paramparā (teacher-student lineage) essential in Vedāntic transmission. Vasiṣṭha's direct realization qualifies him to teach; his teaching will enable the sages to become true purohitas, guides who lead from direct knowledge rather than mere scriptural learning. Each generation of realized teachers ensures the teaching remains alive, rooted in experience rather than degenerating into dead dogma.\n\nThe text subtly indicates that even great sages require a teacher with direct realization. Knowledge cannot be attained through study alone, nor through ritual practice alone, nor through mere reasoning. The teacher who has \"seen\"—who possesses aparokṣa-jñāna—can ignite that same recognition in qualified students. This is śravaṇa (hearing from the teacher), the first step in the classical Vedāntic methodology of śravaṇa-manana-nididhyāsana (hearing, reflection, meditation).\n\nThe progression implied in the passage—from not-seeing (nāpaśyan) through another's seeing (vasiṣṭhaḥ pratyakṣam apaśyat) to future generation of offspring—maps the complete arc of spiritual transmission. The teaching begins with recognition of one's current state (we do not see directly). It requires encounter with one who does see directly (the qualified guru). Through the guru's teaching about Brahman, the student's vision is corrected, enabling them to become, in turn, guides for others. Thus knowledge perpetuates itself through genuine realization in each generation.\n\n**Practical Application**:\n\nThis passage speaks directly to the necessity of proper guidance on the spiritual path. While self-study (svādhyāya) and personal practice have their place, they cannot substitute for the teaching of one who has direct realization. The spiritual seeker must seek out a teacher established in Brahman-knowledge, one whose words arise from lived understanding rather than mere conceptual learning.\n\nThe distinction between parokṣa and pratyakṣa knowledge offers a criterion for self-assessment. Do I truly know the Self, or do I merely know about it? Have I tasted the reality of non-dual consciousness, or do I hold it as a philosophical position? This honest inquiry prevents the self-deception that mistakes intellectual understanding for genuine realization.\n\nFor those who teach—whether formally as gurus or informally as more experienced practitioners—the passage carries a sobering message. Only one who has \"seen directly\" is qualified to guide others to that seeing. Teaching from secondhand knowledge, no matter how extensive one's learning, cannot transmit the liberating realization. This calls for integrity: if one has not yet realized directly, acknowledge it frankly rather than pose as a realized teacher.\n\nThe passage also addresses the purpose of realization. Vasiṣṭha's direct vision of Indra does not end with his personal liberation; it qualifies and obligates him to teach, enabling others to fulfill their role as guides. Self-realization is not primarily for personal benefit but for the benefit of all beings. The jñānī naturally becomes a teacher, whether through words or mere presence, radiating the knowledge that liberates.\n\nFinally, the reference to generating offspring points to the continuity of the teaching. Each generation of students who realize the truth becomes the next generation of teachers. This is how liberating knowledge survives across centuries—not as preserved texts alone but as living transmission from those who see to those who seek to see. The student today becomes the teacher tomorrow, ensuring the light of knowledge never extinguishes.\n\n**Cross-References**:\n- **Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad 1.2.12-13**: The distinction between aparā and parā vidyā, and the necessity of approaching a teacher who knows Brahman and is established in Brahman\n- **Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.14.2**: \"One who has a teacher knows; for such a one, there is only delay until liberation\"—emphasizing the necessity of proper guidance\n- **Bhagavad Gītā 4.34**: \"Know that by prostration, by questioning, and by service; the wise who have seen the truth will teach you that knowledge\"\n- **Kena Upaniṣad 2.4**: The teaching that Brahman is not what people worship as this or that, pointing to the insufficiency of conceptual knowledge\n- **Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.5**: \"The Self should be heard, reflected upon, and meditated upon\"—the classical three-step methodology that begins with hearing from a realized teacher\n- **Vivekacūḍāmaṇi verse 2**: Śaṅkara's enumeration of the prerequisites for liberation, including association with the wise (sat-saṅga) and hearing the teachings (śravaṇa)\n- **YV's recurring emphasis**: Throughout the text, Vasiṣṭha's direct realization authorizes his teaching to Rāma; this passage provides the mythological foundation for that authority"
